var textSt = `In the Buddha's time, there was a Brahmin named Bhaggava Gagga who was the Royal Chaplain and one of the kingdom's highest dignitaries.
One night, his wife, Mantani, gave birth to a son.
However, that night was not a normal night.
All weapons and armor in the city of Savatthi began to sparkle and glow red.
The stars in the night sky aligned themselves in a strange pattern.
That night, as King Pasenadi of Kosala was lying in his bed...
...all of the weapons in his room began to glow.
Terrified, the king cried out.
Bhaggava, the king's trusted advisor, rushed to his liege's side.
My Lord!? Are you alright? What is wrong?
I heard a loud noise and came running.
Bhaggava, my weapons are glowing!
What does this mean?
My lord, it's happening all over the city.
The stars outside have formed what the wise men are calling the robber's constellation.
They say that anyone born on this night will grow up to be a violent criminal and commit heinous crimes.
Is that so?
This is horrible; I've never heard of anything such as this before.
What must we do?
My lord, I have a confession to make.
As your advisor, I can't withhold this from you.
What is it? What's the matter? Tell me!
My lord, this is all my fault.
Tonight, my wife gave birth to a son.
He is the cause of all of this.
He must be destined to be a terrible criminal.
What? Your wife had a son tonight?
Yes my lord, I can only hope that the prophecies are wrong.
And so, the next morning, Bhaggava brought his baby boy and offered him to the king saying, My lord, if this boy is to grow up to become a fierce criminal, I offer him to you for execution.
The king took a good look at the baby and said, We can't kill a baby based on a prophecy.
Raise him well, teach him morality and hope that the prophecy does not come true.
Thank you my lord! Thank you for your wisdom and kindness.
I will raise him to be a good person!
And so, the baby boy was named Ahimsaka, which means he who causes no harm to others.
Ahimsaka grew up to be strong and was well-loved by others.
He focused on his studies, prayed to the gods, and was kind to animals.
Ahimsaka was physically superior to all of his peers.
He could run faster than any of them without becoming tired.
He was much stronger than any of his fellow students.
Ahimsaka was also nimble and dexterous.
Things that were difficult for others were easy for Ahimsaka.
He quickly mastered all the forms of fighting and martial arts that he was taught.
Ahimsaka was the most favored student of the school's famous teacher.
While many students were in awe of Ahimsaka, many others were envious of him.
Ahimsaka easily beat his opponents in physical combat.
His physical skill clearly surpassed others.
His strength was unmatched.
His proficiency with weapons was unmatched.
Ahimsaka trained himself mentally as well.
He practiced humility and spent much of his time caring for his teacher.
This only made the teacher like him more.
All of the jealous students came together.
They devised a plan to take care of Ahimsaka for good.
And so the jealous students went to the teacher.
They told him that they heard rumors that Ahimsaka had plans to kill him and take over as the new teacher.
The teacher brushed off these rumors.
Not too long after that, another set of students sought to convince the teacher of these rumors.
The teacher brushed these rumors off as well, but began to wonder if there was any truth in them.
A third set of students came to report that they too heard these disturbing rumors.
The teacher tried to brush them off but was greatly troubled.
He thought, If all these people heard the same thing, then the rumors must be true.
How could so many people all believe the same thing if it were a lie?
The truth is obvious: Ahimsaka worked hard so that he could kill me and take over my school.
That is the only reason that makes sense.
I must do something about this before it is too late.
And so, the teacher summoned Ahimsaka.
The teacher said, My son, Ahimsaka, you have studied hard, trained hard, and have learned and mastered all that my school has to teach.
Thank you teacher.
However, there is one more task that you must complete before I can allow you to graduate from my school.
Of course, teacher, I will do anything.
Just tell me what I need to do and it will be done.
According to the greatest scroll of our school, you must go out into the world and gather one thousand right thumbs.
Then, you will gain access to an ancient technique that you can use to save lives, heal the sick, and even revive the dead!
Teacher, but, in order to get those thumbs, I'd have to hurt and kill people.
I can't do that!
Ah, I see that you have lied.
You said you would do anything I asked, Ahimsaka.
What would it matter?
If you succeed, you can just revive the people you killed.
I guess all the time I invested in you was a waste.
It is clear that you are not ready to graduate.
Think about how your parents will feel when you return home a failure.
But teacher, I would do anything else if you asked me.
You surely cannot mean for me to go out into the world and harm so many people.
It is your choice Ahimsaka.
The path is in front of you - either accept it, or quit and return home a failure.
It is your choice.
Teacher, you have never lied to me, nor have you ever led me astray.
I will place my trust in you and do as you instruct.
Ahimsaka imagined all the pain and suffering he would cause if he were to embark on this quest.
But then, he thought that if he achieved his goal, he could use the knowledge and powers he gained to help many people.
Reluctantly, Ahimsaka went to the weapons room and gathered the gear he needed for his quest.
To the satisfaction of the jealous students, Ahimsaka bid everyone farewell and left to begin his final trial.
Ahimsaka set his mind to the quest at hand.
He thought, If I am going to do this, I will do this with all my might.
I must throw every ounce of my energy and wisdom towards completing this task.
Ahimsaka set off for the forest and began searching out criminals and bandits.
None of them stood a chance.
After his first kills, Ahimsaka was shaken to his very core.
In his entire life, he had never intentionally harmed another living being, let alone taken a life.
He lived a loving and kind life, never wishing harm on others.
Yet, here he was, covered in the blood of the people whose lives he took.
Seeing the blood on his hands, Ahimsaka had a breakdown.
However, after some time, Ahimsaka meditated and regained his focus.
It was now too late to turn back.
The only way forward was to finish his quest.
He dedicated himself to the tasks at hand and told himself that he could mourn after his mission was complete.
Ahimsaka fearlessly and viciously targeted bandits, thieves, rapists, murderers and other violent criminals.
Regardless of their numbers, they did not stand a chance against Ahimsaka.
Ahimsaka removed their thumbs and added them to his collection.
He carried them in a bag, but the blood dripped everywhere and the rotting flesh began to smell.
Ahimsaka then came up with an idea.
He strung the fingers together and let the vultures and animals pick all the meat off the bones.
After the animals were done, he gathered the bones and dried them out in the sun.
The fingers were vital to the success of his quest, in order not to lose them, Ahimsaka wove them into a necklace which he began to wear around his neck at all times.
People who saw him began to call him Angulimala, which means Finger-Necklace.
After clearing the forest of all criminals and bandits, Angulimala began to target anyone who happened to travel through the forest.
With his skill and focus, no one stood a chance.
Anyone who crossed his path added to his finger collection.
A sizable bounty was placed on Angulimala's head, and many sought to claim it.
However, they did not realize that in doing so, they would be contributing to Angulimala's necklace.
News of Angulimala spread to nearby towns and villages.
The terrified people packed up what they could carry and abandoned their homes.
When Angulimala arrived in a town, anyone who was left became his targets.
Angulimala wiped out many villages and towns in this manner.
News of Angulimala traveled quickly and reached the capital city.
Even soldiers were terrified of him.
Rumors of the vicious murders began to spread.
People began to protest outside the royal palace, demanding that the king take action.
King Pasenadi called his trusted advisor Bhaggava and asked him to order the troops to capture this vicious bandit known as Angulimala.
Both the king and Bhaggava were not sure that they could capture this prolific killer.
Bhaggava, forever loyal to the king, gave his word that he would capture this bandit.
Bhaggava proclaimed a royal decree that ordered all soldiers and mercenaries to go after Angulimala.
When Mantani, his wife, heard the decree, her motherly instincts kicked in.
She knew that this murderer named Angulimala was none other than her son.
She said, My husband, I sense that this Angulimala is our son, Ahimsaka.
You can't send the soldiers after him.
He is our son!
If he has done what they say he has done, then let him be captured and executed.
He is no son of mine.
No! Don't say that! He is our son! Please! You must help him.
After her pleas fell on deaf ears, Mantani, Ahimsaka's mother, put on a disguise.
She left the palace at the crack of dawn.
On that very same morning, as he did every morning, the Buddha extended his divine eye to survey the entire world looking for one who is ready and suitable to receive his divine help.
The Buddha saw that on this day, Angulimala would encounter his mother.
Until this moment, Angulimala had cultivated enough paramitas to be able to become enlightened in this life.
However, if Angulimala were to kill his mother, he would have committed one of the five anantarika-kammas, heinous actions that block any chance of enlightenment in this life, and lead to an immediate rebirth in hell.
The five anantarika-kammas include: Intentionally killing one's mother Intentionally killing one's father Killing an Arahant Causing a schism within the Sangha, the community of monks and nuns.
Shedding the blood of a Buddha.
If Angulimala were to commit an Anantarika-kamma, the magnitude of this kamma would prevent him from attaining any stage of enlightenment in that lifetime.
After his death, he would be reborn in Avici Niraya, the lowest level of hell.
There, he would spend countless lifetimes enduring unspeakable torment and pain.
Each time he died in hell, he would be reincarnated back in the same place and forced to go through the torment and suffering again.
The Buddha, in his infinite compassion for the suffering of lost souls, walked to the location where Angulimala was about to meet his mother.
Angulimala was perched in a tree in the forest.
He was waiting for a hapless traveler to prey on.
Angulimala had amassed 999 fingers.
This would be the final finger needed to complete his quest.
Angulimala could see a woman walking down the path towards him.
Angulimala's mother, Mantani, shook with fear as she walked in the quiet forest.
She was scared and wanted to go home, but her instincts as a mother moved her to keep proceeding in order to save her son.
After not too long, with his good eyesight, Angulimala recognized that the scared woman was his mother.
However, Angulimala just thought, the sooner I get this done, the sooner I can begin helping people with the wisdom in the scroll.
If my mother must supply the thousandth finger, then so be it.
I can just revive her after I complete the quest.
However, Angulimala noticed another person on the path walking towards him.
It was a monk.
Given the choice between killing his mother or the monk, Angulimala easily chose the monk.
Little did he know that the monk he chose as his target was not any regular monk, but the Lord Buddha himself.
Angulimala leapt down from his hiding spot, expecting to cleave his target in one strike.
However, something strange happened.
No matter how fast Angulimala ran or how hard he tried, he could not gain any ground or get closer to the Buddha.
In fact, the faster he ran, the greater the distance seemed to grow between them.
This greatly shook Angulimala.
In the past, he was able to chase down even the fastest horses.
How could a monk, who was merely walking, be beyond his grasp?
Angulimala screamed out, Monk, STOP!
The Buddha, without stopping, said, Angulimala, I have stopped.
It is you who has not stopped.
Angulimala yelled out, Monk!
It is wrong for you to lie so blatantly.
Anyone can see that you are walking and therefore have not stopped.
I am standing here, obviously I have stopped.
How could you lie so shamelessly?
It is not befitting of a monk!
The Buddha then said, Angulimala, I have stopped.
I have stopped harming others.
I have stopped all my desires.
I have stopped all my attachments.
Therefore, I have stopped creating karma.
Therefore, I have stopped all future rebirths.
You, however, have not stopped.
You continue to kill and harm others, which will lead to undesirable karma and rebirths.
You have guaranteed that you have suffering ahead of you.
It is you who has not stopped.
The depths of the Buddha's words pierced through any resistance Angulimala had.
It felt as if the Buddha was speaking directly to his heart.
Angulimala dropped to his knees, releasing any semblance of resistance.
He knew then and there that the monk in front of him was not just any monk, but the Lord Buddha.
Angulimala raised his hands in reverence.
The Buddha, seeing that Angulimala was ready to receive his help, said, Angulimala, all creatures in this world value their lives.
They do not want to be hurt.
They do not want to die.
This is a universal truth.
Killing and harming others creates undesirable karma.
It creates a karmic contract for which you must be reborn in suffering states to fulfill.
My lord, you are right.
I was foolish to think that I could kill people in order to help them.
My actions have only caused pain and suffering, for others and for myself.
I see the error of my ways.
I repent my lord, I repent.
Please guide me, please teach me, please be my refuge out of the darkness.
Angulimala got up and disposed of all of his weapons and tools of murder.
He returned and bowed at the Buddha's feet.
Please my lord, accept me as your humble disciple.
Guide me towards the path that you have gracefully walked so that I may follow in your footsteps.
And so Angulimala became a disciple of the Buddha.
Soon, Angulimala, the mass murderer, ordained as a monk under the Buddha.
At that time, King Pasenadi was leading his army to hunt Angulimala.
The king decided to stop and ask the Buddha for blessings before his hunt.
Great king, what has brought you here today to see me?
My lord Buddha, there is a mass murderer out there terrorizing my people.
They demand that I catch him and bring him to justice.
However, he is a vicious and powerful opponent.
I fear that I will fail.
I have come to request your blessing and advice.
Great king of men, if you were to see the murderer that you seek, Angulimala, as a monk, and knew that he had renounced all violence and evil, what would you do?
Venerable Buddha, if that were to be true, I would pay my respects to him, give him food to eat, offer him a saffron robe and care for him for as long as he remained a monk in your order.
That is what I would do.
Great king, search no further.
Look over there.
There is the Angulimala that you seek.
King Pasenadi lost his mindfulness for a second and screamed out in fear, Angulimala!
That's him? Angulimala?
However, the king quickly regained his composure and said, How is it possible?
How could the infamous Angulimala be sitting before me as a monk?
Angulimala then said, The exalted Buddha has shown me the error of my views.
I have renounced all evil and vow to only do good.
I will follow all of the Buddha's teachings until the end of my life.
The king then said, I pay respect to your new life and your dedication.
Please come back to the palace with me and I will build you a nice kuti on my grounds.
In addition, please accept these saffron robes from me as a gift.
Great king, I wish not for comforts or pleasures.
I am content with only having 1 set of robes.
I will sleep in the forest, under the open sky.
For meals, I will only eat what I receive from my alms rounds.
My only desire now is to practice the Dhamma.
The king then proclaimed, It is truly marvelous!
It is truly splendid!
The Buddha is truly amazing to be able to conquer one such as Angulimala and to lead him towards the right path.
I never would have thought it possible that one who has done as much evil as Angulimala would repent and change his ways!
When Angulimala's parents heard the news from the king, they felt truly blissful knowing their son had found his way back to the Right Path.
Angulimala's new life as a monk was not easy.
He had to go out for alms down in the town.
When people saw his broad shoulders and big muscles, they knew he was Angulimala.
They all fled in terror.
On many days, Angulimala went hungry.
However, he did not complain, for he knew this was a very small price to pay for his sins.
On some days, the villagers could not contain their anger and hatred.
Many of them had lost husbands, wives, daughters, sons, fathers and mothers at the hands of Angulimala.
They saw this as their opportunity for payback.
Angulimala, however, did not fight back.
He allowed them to strike him and did not run.
Some villagers hurled feces at him and insulted him.
Some put feces into his bowl.
Some people broke his bowl.
Angulimala bore all of this.
He never spoke out.
He never fought back or ran away.
However, he was very sad.
He knew this was the result of his evil karma and knew that there was much more to come.
Angulimala wondered how hard it would be to be good.
Would he be able to do it?
Would he be able to succeed in staying on the righteous path?
Would people allow him to continue on this path?
Would they try to stand in his way?
A multitude of doubts and despair filled his mind.
Angulimala wiped away the negative thoughts with his wisdom and determination.
He thought, I have done evil, and the results have been set into motion.
My task is not to wallow in fear or despair, but instead to move forward and use the rest of my life to pursue enlightenment.
I will use my past as motivation to never backslide or give up.
Every hit I take, every punishment I endure, I will see as a means of paying back the debts that I owe.
I will harbor no ill will or hatred towards anyone, for that will only prolong my suffering.
I will not concern myself with what might happen or what could happen.
I will only concern myself with thinking good thoughts that lead to enlightenment, speaking only good words that do not harm, and doing good actions that will lead to my enlightenment.
I will not give up, I will not slow down, and I will not stop.
I must succeed. It is the only way.
Angulimala was steadfast in his training.
He upheld the Dhutanga practices, which included only wearing robes made from discarded cloths and not accepting ready-made robes from householders, only eating food collected on bindabhat or alms rounds and not accepting food in a vihara or by invitation to a layman's house, and living under a tree without the shelter of a roof.
These practices furthered his dedication and aversion to possible rebirths in this world.
One day, Angulimala saw a woman who was having severe labor pains.
He felt great karuna, or empathy, for her.
He wanted to help her but he did not know what he could do.
He thought, There is so much suffering in this world.
Human beings suffer so much.
Angulimala went to ask for the Buddha's advice.
He said, Most venerable Lord Buddha, what can I do to help?
The Buddha said, Say to her, 'Sister, since I have been born, I have never purposely taken a life.
By that truth may you and the infant be safe!' My lord, I can't knowingly lie.
I have already taken many lives.
Angulimala, use your wisdom.
Say to her, 'Sister, since I have been born into the noble birth, I have never purposely taken a life.
By that truth may you and the infant be safe!'' Angulimala found the Buddha's words to be very enlightening.
Ever since he was born into the noble birth, which is when he was ordained as a monk, he never purposely took a life.
He was confident in the validity of this truth.
Angulimala let it be known that he would go visit the pregnant woman.
The people there put up a curtain in the pregnant woman's room and prepared a seat for Angulimala.
Angulimala sat down and concentrated his mind and made the asservation of truth, or sacca adhitthana, just as the Buddha had instructed him.
Surprisingly, after Angulimala made his asservation of truth, the baby was born easily and the mother felt no pain.
All the women were astounded.
This monk, by his asservation of truth, had caused a difficult labor to be safe and easy.
The grateful mother spread the word and many other pregnant women requested Angulimala's help.
In many cases, when angry and vengeful people came after Angulimala, the women who received help from Angulimala intervened on his behalf.
They spoke of his good actions and asked that they hold their judgment and anger until he had helped the other pregnant women.
Angulimala's life was better, but far from easy.
He was still attacked often and sustained many injuries.
One day, after a beating, he went to see the Buddha.
My lord, the quest to be good is not easy.
There are so many obstacles in my path.
Just receiving the karmic results of my past actions is very difficult to bear.
Angulimala, bear it! Bear it!
You have experienced here and now the ripening of your karma, which you might have experienced over a year, many centuries, or many millennia.
When one strives for final liberation in a lifetime, past karmas usually ripen quicker in this lifetime.
Bear it, for we have already created the causes, therefore the results are unavoidable.
Use the time you have left in this life to achieve full liberation.
Do not focus on that which is unavoidable, for that would waste your time.
Focus on what you can achieve and go forth with all your might and achieve it.
Angulimala allowed the Buddha's words to imprint into his mind.
He thought about how all beings that cause harm and suffering to other beings will always end up suffering as a result of their actions.
All evil actions result in undesirable births as an outcome.
Angulimala contemplated the suffering that is inherent to life.
When compared to all the suffering living beings are subjected to, what happiness is worth it?
How much happiness would we need to experience to make the multitudes of suffering we experience worth it?
What in life is worth the pain of death?
Nothing in life is permanent; therefore, no happiness will stay with us.
However, the results of our actions stay with us until they are paid.
When we experience pain, others who care for us also suffer.
When others we care about experience suffering, we also experience suffering.
Life is an unending cycle of suffering.
Angulimala recalled all of the experiences of his life.
He reflected upon all the suffering he caused, all the suffering he experienced and all the suffering he was to endure.
His mind, after being shown countless traumatic experiences of suffering, released all attachments.
Once his mind released all attachments, nothing could convince him to be reborn ever again in any realm, causing him to attain full enlightenment as a liberated one, an Arahant.
When asked by the monks why Angulimala killed 999 people, the Buddha told a story of the past.
A long time ago, Angulimala was born as a giant turtle the size of a house.
He was kind and often assisted sea travelers in need.
There was a group of fishermen who rented a ship to sell their goods and wares at the port city.
On this particular trip, the fishermen were able to sell all their goods quickly.
Seeing that it was still early in the day, they decided to spend some of their money to drink and feast.
However, as is common with drinking, the fishermen lost track of time and drank until it was dark.
They did not get back to the sea until the sun started to set.
On their voyage, they encountered rough winds and massive waves.
Eventually, the ship was destroyed and the fishermen were left clutching floating debris to survive.
Off in the distance, the stranded fishermen saw a gigantic turtle the size of a house.
They waved and yelled for the turtle to come and save them.
The turtle saw the stranded humans and felt compassion for them.
Though he could tell that they had been drinking and did not trust them, his compassion overcame his reservations and he decided to help them.
The turtle said, Fishermen, I see that you are in need of help.
I can provide that help.
But I have heard of the wickedness and violence of man; how can I be assured of my safety if I save you?
Great turtle, fear not!
We are loving husbands and fathers who just wish to return home to our wives and children.
If we perish, who will feed them?
Who will protect them?
Think of the women!
Think of the children, great turtle!
I am thinking of your wives and children, but you must first swear that no harm will befall me if I save you.
Great compassionate turtle, we all swear on all that is holy and sacred that no harm shall befall you by our hands.
And so, the turtle swam closer and had all of the survivors climb upon his back.
The turtle then swam the tremendous distance back to the fisherman's home.
When they got home, the giant turtle parked himself on the beach so that the fishermen could disembark.
Now that they no longer feared for their survival, the fishermen thought about the goods they had lost and how this trip was a net loss for them.
They no longer saw the turtle as a savior, but as a valuable commodity from which they could profit.
Giant turtles were considered sacred animals due to their long lives and their meat was in high demand.
People believed that if one ate the meat of a giant turtle, they would be rewarded with a long life.
All the fishermen and villagers agreed that this was an opportunity that should not be wasted.
But out of the entire village, there was a young girl who knew in her heart that this was wrong.
This turtle had saved her people and did not deserve what they were planning.
She felt pity for the turtle, but did not know what to do.
The treacherous fishermen violently captured the compassionate turtle who saved them.
The tied ropes around his body and head.
The entire village worked together to capture the giant turtle.
Then, forgetting their gratitude, they viciously murdered the giant turtle.
The giant turtle died in agony and felt the sting of betrayal overwhelm his heart.
The fishermen held a grand feast to celebrate their massive haul.
The turtle's body would feed their village for many months and the turtle's meat would fetch a hefty price.
The fishermen barbecued some of the turtle's meat for the feast.
The only person who did not eat the meat was the little girl who felt sorry for the kind turtle.
Little did they know, the turtle's spirit was watching.
The turtle thought, I helped you when you were on the brink of death.
I worked hard to ensure your survival.
You made an oath that you broke without any hesitation.
Just as you made a promise to me, I will make a promise to you, and I will keep my promise.
I will never forgive you.
I will return in a future life and take all of your lives, just as you took mine.
Whatever it takes , I will have my revenge. This I swear!
And so, the turtle was eventually reborn as the murderous Angulimala.
The 999 victims were the 999 people who ate the turtle's meat.
The little girl was later reborn as Ahimsaka's mother Mantani.
Since she did not eat the turtle's meat, she was spared.

<muoborder>

En la época del Buda, había un brahmán llamado Bhaggava Gagga que era el Capellán Real y uno de los dignatarios más altos del reino.
Una noche, su esposa, Mantani, dio a luz a un hijo.
Sin embargo, esa noche no fue una noche normal.
Todas las armas y armaduras en la ciudad de Savatthi comenzaron a brillar y resplandecer en rojo.
Las estrellas en el cielo nocturno se alinearon en un patrón extraño.
Esa noche, mientras el rey Pasenadi de Kosala estaba acostado en su cama...
...todas las armas en su habitación comenzaron a brillar.
Aterrorizado, el rey gritó.
Bhaggava, el consejero de confianza del rey, corrió al lado de su señor.
¿Mi señor? ¿Estás bien? ¿Qué pasa?
Escuché un fuerte ruido y vine corriendo.
¡Bhaggava, mis armas están brillando!
¿Qué significa esto?
Mi señor, está sucediendo en toda la ciudad.
Las estrellas afuera han formado lo que los sabios llaman la constelación del ladrón.
Dicen que cualquiera que nazca en esta noche crecerá para ser un criminal violento y cometerá crímenes atroces.
¿Es así?
Esto es horrible; nunca había oído hablar de algo así antes.
¿Qué debemos hacer?
Mi señor, tengo una confesión que hacer.
Como tu consejero, no puedo ocultarte esto.
¿Qué es? ¿Qué pasa? ¡Dímelo!
Mi señor, todo esto es mi culpa.
Esta noche, mi esposa dio a luz a un hijo.
Él es la causa de todo esto.
Debe estar destinado a ser un criminal terrible.
¿Qué? ¿Tu esposa tuvo un hijo esta noche?
Sí, mi señor, solo puedo esperar que las profecías estén equivocadas.
Y así, a la mañana siguiente, Bhaggava trajo a su bebé y lo ofreció al rey diciendo, Mi señor, si este niño va a crecer para convertirse en un criminal feroz, te lo ofrezco para su ejecución.
El rey miró bien al bebé y dijo, No podemos matar a un bebé basándonos en una profecía.
Críalo bien, enséñale moralidad y espera que la profecía no se cumpla.
¡Gracias, mi señor! Gracias por tu sabiduría y bondad.
¡Lo criaré para que sea una buena persona!
Y así, el bebé fue nombrado Ahimsaka, que significa aquel que no causa daño a otros.
Ahimsaka creció para ser fuerte y era muy querido por los demás.
Se enfocó en sus estudios, rezaba a los dioses y era amable con los animales.
Ahimsaka era físicamente superior a todos sus compañeros.
Podía correr más rápido que cualquiera de ellos sin cansarse.
Era mucho más fuerte que cualquiera de sus compañeros estudiantes.
Ahimsaka también era ágil y diestro.
Las cosas que eran difíciles para otros eran fáciles para Ahimsaka.
Rápidamente dominó todas las formas de lucha y artes marciales que le enseñaron.
Ahimsaka era el estudiante más favorecido del famoso maestro de la escuela.
Mientras muchos estudiantes admiraban a Ahimsaka, muchos otros estaban envidiosos de él.
Ahimsaka vencía fácilmente a sus oponentes en combates físicos.
Su habilidad física claramente superaba a los demás.
Su fuerza no tenía igual.
Su destreza con las armas no tenía igual.
Ahimsaka también se entrenó mentalmente.
Practicaba la humildad y pasaba mucho de su tiempo cuidando a su maestro.
Esto solo hizo que el maestro lo quisiera más.
Todos los estudiantes celosos se reunieron.
Idearon un plan para deshacerse de Ahimsaka para siempre.
Y así, los estudiantes celosos fueron al maestro.
Le dijeron que habían oído rumores de que Ahimsaka tenía planes de matarlo y tomar su lugar como nuevo maestro.
El maestro desestimó estos rumores.
No mucho después, otro grupo de estudiantes intentó convencer al maestro de estos rumores.
El maestro también desestimó estos rumores, pero comenzó a preguntarse si habría algo de verdad en ellos.
Un tercer grupo de estudiantes vino a reportar que también habían oído estos rumores perturbadores.
El maestro intentó desestimarlos, pero estaba muy perturbado.
Pensó, si tanta gente ha oído lo mismo, entonces los rumores deben ser ciertos.
¿Cómo podrían tantas personas creer lo mismo si fuera mentira?
La verdad es obvia: Ahimsaka trabajó duro para poder matarme y tomar el control de mi escuela.
Esa es la única razón que tiene sentido.
Debo hacer algo al respecto antes de que sea demasiado tarde.
Y así, el maestro convocó a Ahimsaka.
El maestro dijo, Hijo mío, Ahimsaka, has estudiado mucho, entrenado mucho y has aprendido y dominado todo lo que mi escuela tiene para enseñar.
Gracias, maestro.
Sin embargo, hay una tarea más que debes completar antes de que pueda permitirte graduarte de mi escuela.
Por supuesto, maestro, haré cualquier cosa.
Solo dime qué necesito hacer y lo haré.
Según el pergamino más importante de nuestra escuela, debes salir al mundo y recolectar mil pulgares derechos.
Entonces, obtendrás acceso a una técnica antigua que puedes usar para salvar vidas, curar a los enfermos e incluso revivir a los muertos.
Maestro, pero, para conseguir esos pulgares, tendría que herir y matar a personas.
¡No puedo hacer eso!
Ah, veo que has mentido.
Dijiste que harías cualquier cosa que te pidiera, Ahimsaka.
¿Qué importaría?
Si tienes éxito, puedes simplemente revivir a las personas que mataste.
Supongo que todo el tiempo que invertí en ti fue una pérdida.
Está claro que no estás listo para graduarte.
Piensa en cómo se sentirán tus padres cuando regreses a casa como un fracasado.
Pero maestro, haría cualquier otra cosa si me lo pidieras.
Seguramente no puedes querer que salga al mundo y dañe a tantas personas.
Es tu elección, Ahimsaka.
El camino está frente a ti: o lo aceptas, o renuncias y regresas a casa como un fracasado.
Es tu elección.
Maestro, nunca me has mentido, ni me has llevado por mal camino.
Pondré mi confianza en ti y haré lo que me indiques.
Ahimsaka imaginó todo el dolor y sufrimiento que causaría si emprendiera esta búsqueda.
Pero luego, pensó que si lograba su objetivo, podría usar el conocimiento y los poderes que obtuviera para ayudar a muchas personas.
De mala gana, Ahimsaka fue a la sala de armas y reunió el equipo que necesitaba para su búsqueda.
Para satisfacción de los estudiantes celosos, Ahimsaka se despidió de todos y partió para comenzar su prueba final.
Ahimsaka puso su mente en la búsqueda que tenía por delante.
Pensó, si voy a hacer esto, lo haré con todas mis fuerzas.
Debo poner cada gramo de mi energía y sabiduría en completar esta tarea.
Ahimsaka partió hacia el bosque y comenzó a buscar criminales y bandidos.
Ninguno de ellos tuvo oportunidad.
Después de sus primeros asesinatos, Ahimsaka quedó profundamente conmocionado.
En toda su vida, nunca había dañado intencionalmente a otro ser vivo, mucho menos quitado una vida.
Vivió una vida amorosa y amable, nunca deseando daño a otros.
Sin embargo, aquí estaba, cubierto de la sangre de las personas cuyas vidas había tomado.
Al ver la sangre en sus manos, Ahimsaka tuvo un colapso.
Sin embargo, después de un tiempo, Ahimsaka meditó y recuperó su enfoque.
Ahora era demasiado tarde para dar marcha atrás.
El único camino hacia adelante era terminar su búsqueda.
Se dedicó a las tareas en cuestión y se dijo a sí mismo que podría lamentarse después de que su misión estuviera completa.
Ahimsaka atacó sin miedo y con ferocidad a bandidos, ladrones, violadores, asesinos y otros criminales violentos.
Sin importar su número, no tenían ninguna posibilidad contra Ahimsaka.
Ahimsaka les quitaba los pulgares y los añadía a su colección.
Los llevaba en una bolsa, pero la sangre goteaba por todas partes y la carne en descomposición comenzó a oler.
Entonces, Ahimsaka tuvo una idea.
Ensartó los dedos juntos y dejó que los buitres y los animales quitaran toda la carne de los huesos.
Después de que los animales terminaron, reunió los huesos y los secó al sol.
Los dedos eran vitales para el éxito de su búsqueda, para no perderlos, Ahimsaka los tejió en un collar que comenzó a llevar alrededor de su cuello en todo momento.
Las personas que lo veían comenzaron a llamarlo Angulimala, que significa Collar de Dedos.
Después de limpiar el bosque de todos los criminales y bandidos, Angulimala comenzó a atacar a cualquiera que pasara por el bosque.
Con su habilidad y enfoque, nadie tenía oportunidad.
Cualquiera que cruzara su camino se añadía a su colección de dedos.
Se colocó una considerable recompensa por la cabeza de Angulimala, y muchos intentaron reclamarla.
Sin embargo, no se daban cuenta de que al hacerlo, estarían contribuyendo al collar de Angulimala.
Las noticias de Angulimala se extendieron a los pueblos y aldeas cercanas.
La gente aterrorizada empacó lo que podía llevar y abandonó sus hogares.
Cuando Angulimala llegaba a un pueblo, cualquiera que quedara se convertía en su objetivo.
Angulimala eliminó muchos pueblos y aldeas de esta manera.
Las noticias de Angulimala viajaron rápidamente y llegaron a la ciudad capital.
Incluso los soldados estaban aterrorizados de él.
Los rumores de los asesinatos viciosos comenzaron a extenderse.
La gente comenzó a protestar fuera del palacio real, exigiendo que el rey tomara medidas.
El rey Pasenadi llamó a su consejero de confianza Bhaggava y le pidió que ordenara a las tropas capturar a este bandido vicioso conocido como Angulimala.
Tanto el rey como Bhaggava no estaban seguros de que pudieran capturar a este asesino prolífico.
Bhaggava, siempre leal al rey, dio su palabra de que capturaría a este bandido.
Bhaggava proclamó un decreto real que ordenaba a todos los soldados y mercenarios ir tras Angulimala.
Cuando Mantani, su esposa, escuchó el decreto, sus instintos maternales se activaron.
Sabía que este asesino llamado Angulimala no era otro que su hijo.
Dijo, Mi esposo, siento que este Angulimala es nuestro hijo, Ahimsaka.
¡No puedes enviar a los soldados tras él!
¡Es nuestro hijo!
Si ha hecho lo que dicen que ha hecho, que lo capturen y lo ejecuten.
¡No es mi hijo!
¡No! ¡No digas eso! ¡Es nuestro hijo! ¡Por favor! Debes ayudarlo.
Después de que sus súplicas cayeron en oídos sordos, Mantani, la madre de Ahimsaka, se puso un disfraz.
Dejó el palacio al amanecer.
Esa misma mañana, como hacía todas las mañanas, el Buda extendió su ojo divino para inspeccionar el mundo entero buscando a alguien que estuviera listo y adecuado para recibir su ayuda divina.
El Buda vio que en este día, Angulimala encontraría a su madre.
Hasta este momento, Angulimala había cultivado suficientes paramitas para poder alcanzar la iluminación en esta vida.
Sin embargo, si Angulimala matara a su madre, habría cometido uno de los cinco anantarika-kammas, acciones atroces que bloquean cualquier posibilidad de iluminación en esta vida y conducen a un renacimiento inmediato en el infierno.
Los cinco anantarika-kammas incluyen: Matar intencionalmente a la propia madre, Matar intencionalmente al propio padre, Matar a un Arahant, Causar un cisma dentro de la Sangha, la comunidad de monjes y monjas.
Derramar la sangre de un Buda.
Si Angulimala cometiera un anantarika-kamma, la magnitud de este kamma le impediría alcanzar cualquier etapa de iluminación en esa vida.
Después de su muerte, renacería en Avici Niraya, el nivel más bajo del infierno.
Allí, pasaría innumerables vidas soportando tormentos y dolores indescriptibles.
Cada vez que muriera en el infierno, renacería en el mismo lugar y sería forzado a pasar por el tormento y el sufrimiento nuevamente.
El Buda, en su infinita compasión por el sufrimiento de las almas perdidas, caminó hacia el lugar donde Angulimala estaba a punto de encontrarse con su madre.
Angulimala estaba encaramado en un árbol en el bosque.
Estaba esperando a un viajero desafortunado para atacarlo.
Angulimala había acumulado 999 dedos.
Este sería el dedo final necesario para completar su búsqueda.
Angulimala podía ver a una mujer caminando por el sendero hacia él.
La madre de Angulimala, Mantani, temblaba de miedo mientras caminaba en el silencioso bosque.
Estaba asustada y quería volver a casa, pero su instinto de madre la impulsaba a seguir adelante para salvar a su hijo.
No mucho después, con su buena vista, Angulimala reconoció que la mujer asustada era su madre.
Sin embargo, Angulimala solo pensó, cuanto antes termine esto, antes podré comenzar a ayudar a las personas con la sabiduría del pergamino.
Si mi madre debe proporcionar el milésimo dedo, que así sea.
Puedo simplemente revivirla después de completar la búsqueda.
Sin embargo, Angulimala notó a otra persona en el sendero caminando hacia él.
Era un monje.
Dado a elegir entre matar a su madre o al monje, Angulimala fácilmente eligió al monje.
Poco sabía que el monje que eligió como objetivo no era un monje cualquiera, sino el propio Señor Buda.
Angulimala saltó desde su escondite, esperando cortar a su objetivo de un solo golpe.
Sin embargo, ocurrió algo extraño.
No importaba cuán rápido corriera Angulimala o cuánto lo intentara, no podía acercarse al Buda.
De hecho, cuanto más rápido corría, mayor parecía crecer la distancia entre ellos.
Esto sacudió profundamente a Angulimala.
En el pasado, había sido capaz de alcanzar incluso a los caballos más rápidos.
¿Cómo podía un monje, que simplemente estaba caminando, estar fuera de su alcance?
Angulimala gritó, ¡Monje, PARA!
El Buda, sin detenerse, dijo, Angulimala, yo he parado.
Eres tú quien no ha parado.
Angulimala gritó, ¡Monje!
Es incorrecto que mientas tan descaradamente.
Cualquiera puede ver que estás caminando y, por lo tanto, no has parado.
Estoy aquí de pie, obviamente he parado.
¿Cómo puedes mentir tan descaradamente?
¡No es propio de un monje!
El Buda entonces dijo, Angulimala, yo he parado.
He dejado de dañar a otros.
He detenido todos mis deseos.
He detenido todos mis apegos.
Por lo tanto, he detenido la creación de karma.
Por lo tanto, he detenido todos los renacimientos futuros.
Tú, sin embargo, no has parado.
Sigues matando y dañando a otros, lo que llevará a un karma indeseable y renacimientos.
Has garantizado que tienes sufrimiento por delante.
Eres tú quien no ha parado.
La profundidad de las palabras del Buda atravesó cualquier resistencia que Angulimala tuviera.
Se sentía como si el Buda estuviera hablando directamente a su corazón.
Angulimala cayó de rodillas, liberando cualquier apariencia de resistencia.
Supo entonces que el monje frente a él no era un monje cualquiera, sino el Señor Buda.
Angulimala levantó las manos en reverencia.
El Buda, viendo que Angulimala estaba listo para recibir su ayuda, dijo, Angulimala, todas las criaturas en este mundo valoran sus vidas.
No quieren ser lastimadas.
No quieren morir.
Esta es una verdad universal.
Matar y dañar a otros crea un karma indeseable.
Crea un contrato kármico por el cual debes renacer en estados de sufrimiento para cumplirlo.
Mi señor, tienes razón.
Fui un necio al pensar que podía matar personas para ayudarlas.
Mis acciones solo han causado dolor y sufrimiento, para otros y para mí mismo.
Veo el error de mis caminos.
Me arrepiento, mi señor, me arrepiento.
Por favor, guíame, enséñame, sé mi refugio para salir de la oscuridad.
Angulimala se levantó y se deshizo de todas sus armas y herramientas de asesinato.
Regresó e inclinó la cabeza a los pies del Buda.
Por favor, mi señor, acéptame como tu humilde discípulo.
Guíame hacia el camino que has recorrido con gracia para que pueda seguir tus pasos.
Y así, Angulimala se convirtió en discípulo del Buda.
Pronto, Angulimala, el asesino en masa, se ordenó como monje bajo el Buda.
En ese momento, el rey Pasenadi lideraba su ejército para cazar a Angulimala.
El rey decidió detenerse y pedirle bendiciones al Buda antes de su cacería.
Gran rey, ¿qué te ha traído hoy aquí para verme?
Mi señor Buda, hay un asesino en masa aterrorizando a mi pueblo.
Exigen que lo capture y lo lleve ante la justicia.
Sin embargo, es un oponente vicioso y poderoso.
Temo que fracasaré.
He venido a solicitar tu bendición y consejo.
Gran rey de los hombres, si vieras al asesino que buscas, Angulimala, como monje, y supieras que ha renunciado a toda violencia y maldad, ¿qué harías?
Venerable Buda, si eso fuera cierto, le rendiría mis respetos, le daría comida para comer, le ofrecería una túnica de azafrán y cuidaría de él mientras permaneciera como monje en tu orden.
Eso es lo que haría.
Gran rey, no busques más.
Mira allí.
Ese es el Angulimala que buscas.
El rey Pasenadi perdió su atención por un segundo y gritó de miedo, ¡Angulimala!
¿Ese es él? ¿Angulimala?
Sin embargo, el rey rápidamente recuperó la compostura y dijo, ¿Cómo es posible?
¿Cómo podría el infame Angulimala estar sentado frente a mí como monje?
Angulimala entonces dijo, El exaltado Buda me ha mostrado el error de mis puntos de vista.
He renunciado a todo mal y juro solo hacer el bien.
Seguiré todas las enseñanzas del Buda hasta el final de mi vida.
El rey entonces dijo, Rindo respeto a tu nueva vida y tu dedicación.
Por favor, vuelve al palacio conmigo y construiré una bonita kuti en mis terrenos.
Además, por favor acepta estas túnicas de azafrán de mi parte como regalo.
Gran rey, no deseo comodidades ni placeres.
Estoy contento con solo tener un conjunto de túnicas.
Dormiré en el bosque, bajo el cielo abierto.
Para las comidas, solo comeré lo que reciba de mis rondas de limosnas.
Mi único deseo ahora es practicar el Dhamma.
El rey entonces proclamó, ¡Es verdaderamente maravilloso!
¡Es verdaderamente espléndido!
¡El Buda es verdaderamente asombroso por ser capaz de conquistar a alguien como Angulimala y guiarlo hacia el camino correcto!
¡Nunca habría pensado que alguien que ha hecho tanto mal como Angulimala se arrepintiera y cambiara sus caminos!
Cuando los padres de Angulimala escucharon las noticias del rey, se sintieron verdaderamente felices sabiendo que su hijo había encontrado el camino de regreso al Camino Correcto.
La nueva vida de Angulimala como monje no fue fácil.
Tenía que salir a pedir limosnas en el pueblo.
Cuando la gente veía sus hombros anchos y músculos grandes, sabían que era Angulimala.
Todos huían aterrorizados.
Muchos días, Angulimala pasaba hambre.
Sin embargo, no se quejaba, pues sabía que esto era un precio muy pequeño a pagar por sus pecados.
Algunos días, los aldeanos no podían contener su ira y odio.
Muchos de ellos habían perdido esposos, esposas, hijas, hijos, padres y madres a manos de Angulimala.
Veían esto como su oportunidad para vengarse.
Sin embargo, Angulimala no contraatacaba.
Permitía que lo golpearan y no corría.
Algunos aldeanos le arrojaban heces y lo insultaban.
Algunos ponían heces en su cuenco.
Algunas personas rompían su cuenco.
Angulimala soportaba todo esto.
Nunca hablaba.
Nunca contraatacaba ni huía.
Sin embargo, estaba muy triste.
Sabía que esto era el resultado de su karma maligno y sabía que aún había mucho más por venir.
Angulimala se preguntaba cuán difícil sería ser bueno.
¿Podría lograrlo?
¿Podría tener éxito en mantenerse en el camino recto?
¿Permitirían las personas que continuara en este camino?
¿Intentarían interponerse en su camino?
Una multitud de dudas y desesperación llenaban su mente.
Angulimala eliminó los pensamientos negativos con su sabiduría y determinación.
Pensó, he hecho el mal, y los resultados han sido puestos en marcha.
Mi tarea no es regodearme en el miedo o la desesperación, sino avanzar y usar el resto de mi vida para perseguir la iluminación.
Usaré mi pasado como motivación para nunca retroceder ni rendirme.
Cada golpe que reciba, cada castigo que soporte, lo veré como una forma de pagar las deudas que debo.
No guardaré rencor ni odio hacia nadie, pues eso solo prolongará mi sufrimiento.
No me preocuparé por lo que podría pasar o lo que podría ocurrir.
Solo me preocuparé por pensar pensamientos buenos que conduzcan a la iluminación, hablar solo palabras buenas que no hagan daño, y realizar acciones buenas que conduzcan a mi iluminación.
No me rendiré, no disminuiré la velocidad, y no pararé.
Debo tener éxito. Es el único camino.
Angulimala fue firme en su entrenamiento.
Mantuvo las prácticas de Dhutanga, que incluían usar solo túnicas hechas de telas desechadas y no aceptar túnicas prefabricadas de los laicos, comer solo alimentos recolectados en rondas de limosnas y no aceptar alimentos en un vihara o por invitación a la casa de un laico, y vivir bajo un árbol sin el refugio de un tejado.
Estas prácticas reforzaron su dedicación y aversión a posibles renacimientos en este mundo.
Un día, Angulimala vio a una mujer que tenía fuertes dolores de parto.
Sintió gran karuna, o empatía, por ella.
Quería ayudarla pero no sabía qué podía hacer.
Pensó, hay tanto sufrimiento en este mundo.
Los seres humanos sufren tanto.
Angulimala fue a pedirle consejo al Buda.
Dijo, Venerable Señor Buda, ¿qué puedo hacer para ayudar?
El Buda dijo, Dile, 'Hermana, desde que nací, nunca he tomado una vida intencionalmente.
¡Por esa verdad, que tú y el bebé estén a salvo!' Mi señor, no puedo mentir a sabiendas.
Ya he tomado muchas vidas.
Angulimala, usa tu sabiduría.
Dile, 'Hermana, desde que nací en el nacimiento noble, nunca he tomado una vida intencionalmente.
¡Por esa verdad, que tú y el bebé estén a salvo!' Angulimala encontró las palabras del Buda muy iluminadoras.
Desde que nació en el nacimiento noble, que es cuando fue ordenado como monje, nunca tomó una vida intencionalmente.
Estaba confiado en la validez de esta verdad.
Angulimala hizo saber que visitaría a la mujer embarazada.
La gente allí colocó una cortina en la habitación de la mujer embarazada y preparó un asiento para Angulimala.
Angulimala se sentó y concentró su mente e hizo la aserción de verdad, o sacca adhitthana, tal como el Buda le había instruido.
Sorprendentemente, después de que Angulimala hizo su aserción de verdad, el bebé nació fácilmente y la madre no sintió dolor.
Todas las mujeres quedaron asombradas.
Este monje, mediante su aserción de verdad, había hecho que un parto difícil fuera seguro y fácil.
La madre agradecida difundió la noticia y muchas otras mujeres embarazadas solicitaron la ayuda de Angulimala.
En muchos casos, cuando personas enojadas y vengativas iban tras Angulimala, las mujeres que recibieron ayuda de él intervinieron en su favor.
Hablaron de sus buenas acciones y pidieron que retuvieran su juicio e ira hasta que hubiera ayudado a las otras mujeres embarazadas.
La vida de Angulimala era mejor, pero lejos de ser fácil.
Aún era atacado a menudo y sufría muchas heridas.
Un día, después de una paliza, fue a ver al Buda.
Mi señor, la búsqueda de ser bueno no es fácil.
Hay tantos obstáculos en mi camino.
Solo recibir los resultados kármicos de mis acciones pasadas es muy difícil de soportar.
Angulimala, ¡sopórtalo! ¡Sopórtalo!
Has experimentado aquí y ahora la maduración de tu karma, que podrías haber experimentado durante un año, muchos siglos o muchos milenios.
Cuando uno se esfuerza por la liberación final en una vida, los karmas pasados suelen madurar más rápido en esta vida.
Sopórtalo, porque ya hemos creado las causas, por lo tanto los resultados son inevitables.
Usa el tiempo que te queda en esta vida para lograr la liberación completa.
No te enfoques en lo que es inevitable, porque eso desperdiciaría tu tiempo.
Enfócate en lo que puedes lograr y avanza con todas tus fuerzas y consíguelo.
Angulimala permitió que las palabras del Buda se grabaran en su mente.
Pensó en cómo todos los seres que causan daño y sufrimiento a otros seres siempre terminan sufriendo como resultado de sus acciones.
Todas las acciones malignas resultan en nacimientos indeseables como resultado.
Angulimala contempló el sufrimiento inherente a la vida.
Cuando se compara con todo el sufrimiento al que están sometidos los seres vivos, ¿qué felicidad vale la pena?
¿Cuánta felicidad necesitaríamos experimentar para que las multitudes de sufrimiento que experimentamos valgan la pena?
¿Qué en la vida vale el dolor de la muerte?
Nada en la vida es permanente; por lo tanto, ninguna felicidad se quedará con nosotros.
Sin embargo, los resultados de nuestras acciones se quedan con nosotros hasta que se pagan.
Cuando experimentamos dolor, otros que se preocupan por nosotros también sufren.
Cuando otros que nos importan experimentan sufrimiento, nosotros también experimentamos sufrimiento.
La vida es un ciclo interminable de sufrimiento.
Angulimala recordó todas las experiencias de su vida.
Reflexionó sobre todo el sufrimiento que causó, todo el sufrimiento que experimentó y todo el sufrimiento que debía soportar.
Su mente, después de ser mostrada innumerables experiencias traumáticas de sufrimiento, liberó todos los apegos.
Una vez que su mente liberó todos los apegos, nada podía convencerlo de renacer nunca más en ningún reino, lo que lo llevó a alcanzar la iluminación completa como un liberado, un Arahant.
Cuando los monjes le preguntaron por qué Angulimala mató a 999 personas, el Buda contó una historia del pasado.
Hace mucho tiempo, Angulimala nació como una tortuga gigante del tamaño de una casa.
Era amable y a menudo ayudaba a los viajeros marinos en necesidad.
Había un grupo de pescadores que alquilaron un barco para vender sus bienes y mercancías en la ciudad portuaria.
En este viaje en particular, los pescadores pudieron vender todos sus bienes rápidamente.
Viendo que aún era temprano en el día, decidieron gastar parte de su dinero en beber y banquetear.
Sin embargo, como es común con la bebida, los pescadores perdieron la noción del tiempo y bebieron hasta que oscureció.
No regresaron al mar hasta que el sol comenzó a ponerse.
En su viaje, encontraron vientos fuertes y olas masivas.
Eventualmente, el barco fue destruido y los pescadores quedaron aferrándose a escombros flotantes para sobrevivir.
A lo lejos, los pescadores varados vieron una tortuga gigantesca del tamaño de una casa.
Agitaron y gritaron para que la tortuga viniera a salvarlos.
La tortuga vio a los humanos varados y sintió compasión por ellos.
Aunque podía notar que habían estado bebiendo y no confiaba en ellos, su compasión superó sus reservas y decidió ayudarlos.
La tortuga dijo, Pescadores, veo que necesitan ayuda.
Puedo proporcionar esa ayuda.
Pero he oído de la maldad y violencia del hombre; ¿cómo puedo estar seguro de mi seguridad si los salvo?
Gran tortuga, ¡no temas!
Somos maridos y padres amorosos que solo deseamos regresar a casa con nuestras esposas e hijos.
Si perecemos, ¿quién los alimentará?
¿Quién los protegerá?
¡Piensa en las mujeres!
¡Piensa en los niños, gran tortuga!
Estoy pensando en sus esposas e hijos, pero primero deben jurar que ningún daño me sobrevendrá si los salvo.
Gran tortuga compasiva, todos juramos por todo lo que es santo y sagrado que ningún daño te sobrevendrá por nuestras manos.
Y así, la tortuga nadó más cerca y hizo que todos los sobrevivientes subieran a su espalda.
La tortuga luego nadó la tremenda distancia de regreso al hogar de los pescadores.
Cuando llegaron a casa, la tortuga gigante se estacionó en la playa para que los pescadores pudieran desembarcar.
Ahora que ya no temían por su supervivencia, los pescadores pensaron en los bienes que habían perdido y cómo este viaje había sido una pérdida neta para ellos.
Ya no veían a la tortuga como un salvador, sino como una mercancía valiosa de la cual podían beneficiarse.
Las tortugas gigantes eran consideradas animales sagrados debido a sus largas vidas y su carne estaba en alta demanda.
La gente creía que si uno comía la carne de una tortuga gigante, sería recompensado con una larga vida.
Todos los pescadores y aldeanos acordaron que esta era una oportunidad que no debía desperdiciarse.
Pero de todo el pueblo, había una niña que sabía en su corazón que esto estaba mal.
Esta tortuga había salvado a su gente y no merecía lo que planeaban.
Sintió lástima por la tortuga, pero no sabía qué hacer.
Los pescadores traicioneros capturaron violentamente a la tortuga compasiva que los salvó.
Ataron cuerdas alrededor de su cuerpo y cabeza.
Todo el pueblo trabajó junto para capturar a la tortuga gigante.
Luego, olvidando su gratitud, asesinaron viciosamente a la tortuga gigante.
La tortuga gigante murió en agonía y sintió el aguijón de la traición abrumar su corazón.
Los pescadores celebraron un gran banquete para celebrar su enorme captura.
El cuerpo de la tortuga alimentaría a su pueblo durante muchos meses y la carne de la tortuga traería un alto precio.
Los pescadores asaron parte de la carne de la tortuga para el banquete.
La única persona que no comió la carne fue la niña que sintió lástima por la tortuga amable.
Poco sabían ellos, el espíritu de la tortuga estaba observando.
La tortuga pensó, Te ayudé cuando estabas al borde de la muerte.
Trabajé duro para asegurar tu supervivencia.
Hiciste un juramento que rompiste sin ninguna hesitación.
Así como me hiciste una promesa, yo te haré una promesa, y mantendré mi promesa.
Nunca te perdonaré.
Regresaré en una vida futura y tomaré todas tus vidas, así como tú tomaste la mía.
Cueste lo que cueste, tendré mi venganza. ¡Esto lo juro!
Y así, la tortuga eventualmente renació como el asesino Angulimala.
Las 999 víctimas fueron las 999 personas que comieron la carne de la tortuga.
La niña fue luego renacida como la madre de Ahimsaka, Mantani.
Dado que no comió la carne de la tortuga, fue perdonada.

<muoborder>

À l'époque du Bouddha, il y avait un brahmane nommé Bhaggava Gagga qui était l'Aumônier Royal et l'un des plus hauts dignitaires du royaume.
Une nuit, son épouse, Mantani, donna naissance à un fils.
Cependant, cette nuit n'était pas une nuit ordinaire.
Toutes les armes et armures de la ville de Savatthi se mirent à étinceler et à luire d'une lueur rouge.
Les étoiles dans le ciel nocturne s'alignèrent selon une configuration étrange.
Cette nuit-là, alors que le roi Pasenadi de Kosala était allongé dans son lit...
... toutes les armes dans sa chambre se mirent à luire.
Terrifié, le roi poussa un cri.
Bhaggava, le conseiller de confiance du roi, se précipita au côté de son souverain.
Mon Seigneur !? Tout va bien ? Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
J'ai entendu un grand bruit et j'ai accouru.
Bhaggava, mes armes brillent !
Qu'est-ce que cela signifie ?
Mon seigneur, cela se produit dans toute la ville.
Les étoiles à l'extérieur ont formé ce que les sages appellent la constellation du voleur.
Ils disent que quiconque naît cette nuit deviendra un criminel violent et commettra des crimes atroces.
Vraiment ?
C'est horrible ; je n'ai jamais entendu parler d'une telle chose auparavant.
Que devons-nous faire ?
Mon seigneur, j'ai une confession à faire.
En tant que votre conseiller, je ne peux pas vous cacher cela.
Qu'y a-t-il ? Qu'est-ce qui se passe ? Dites-moi !
Mon seigneur, tout est de ma faute.
Cette nuit, mon épouse a donné naissance à un fils.
Il est la cause de tout cela.
Il doit être destiné à être un terrible criminel.
Quoi ? Votre femme a eu un fils cette nuit ?
Oui, mon seigneur, je ne peux qu'espérer que les prophéties ont tort.
Et ainsi, le lendemain matin, Bhaggava apporta son bébé et l'offrit au roi en disant : Mon seigneur, si ce garçon doit grandir pour devenir un criminel féroce, je vous l'offre pour qu'il soit exécuté.
Le roi regarda longuement le bébé et dit : Nous ne pouvons pas tuer un bébé sur la base d'une prophétie.
Élevez-le bien, enseignez-lui la moralité et espérez que la prophétie ne se réalise pas.
Merci, mon seigneur ! Merci pour votre sagesse et votre bonté.
Je l'élèverai pour qu'il soit une bonne personne !
Et ainsi, le bébé fut nommé Ahimsaka, ce qui signifie "celui qui ne cause aucun mal à autrui".
Ahimsaka devint fort et fut aimé des autres.
Il se concentra sur ses études, pria les dieux et fut gentil avec les animaux.
Ahimsaka était physiquement supérieur à tous ses pairs.
Il pouvait courir plus vite qu'aucun d'eux sans se fatiguer.
Il était bien plus fort que ses camarades étudiants.
Ahimsaka était également agile et adroit.
Les choses difficiles pour les autres étaient faciles pour Ahimsaka.
Il maîtrisa rapidement toutes les formes de combat et arts martiaux qu'on lui enseigna.
Ahimsaka était l'étudiant le plus favori du célèbre maître de l'école.
Alors que de nombreux étudiants étaient en admiration devant Ahimsaka, beaucoup d'autres étaient envieux de lui.
Ahimsaka battait facilement ses adversaires en combat physique.
Son habileté physique dépassait clairement celle des autres.
Sa force était sans égale.
Sa maîtrise des armes était inégalée.
Ahimsaka s'entraînait aussi mentalement.
Il pratiquait l'humilité et passait beaucoup de temps à s'occuper de son maître.
Cela ne fit que renforcer l'affection du maître pour lui.
Tous les étudiants jaloux se réunirent.
Ils conçurent un plan pour se débarrasser définitivement d'Ahimsaka.
Et ainsi, les étudiants jaloux allèrent voir le maître.
Ils lui dirent qu'ils avaient entendu des rumeurs selon lesquelles Ahimsaka projetait de le tuer et de prendre sa place en tant que nouveau maître.
Le maître écarta ces rumeurs.
Peu de temps après, un autre groupe d'étudiants chercha à convaincre le maître de ces rumeurs.
Le maître écarta également ces rumeurs, mais commença à se demander s'il n'y avait pas une part de vérité.
Un troisième groupe d'étudiants vint rapporter qu'eux aussi avaient entendu ces rumeurs inquiétantes.
Le maître tenta de les ignorer mais fut grandement troublé.
Il pensa : Si tous ces gens ont entendu la même chose, alors les rumeurs doivent être vraies.
Comment tant de gens pourraient-ils croire la même chose si c'était un mensonge ?
La vérité est évidente : Ahimsaka a travaillé dur pour pouvoir me tuer et prendre le contrôle de mon école.
C'est la seule raison logique.
Je dois faire quelque chose avant qu'il ne soit trop tard.
Et ainsi, le maître convoqua Ahimsaka.
Le maître dit : Mon fils, Ahimsaka, tu as étudié dur, t'es entraîné dur et as appris et maîtrisé tout ce que mon école a à enseigner.
Merci, maître.
Cependant, il y a une dernière tâche que tu dois accomplir avant que je puisse te laisser diplômer de mon école.
Bien sûr, maître, je ferai n'importe quoi.
Dites-moi simplement ce que je dois faire et ce sera fait.
Selon le plus grand parchemin de notre école, tu dois aller dans le monde et rassembler mille pouces droits.
Alors, tu auras accès à une technique ancienne que tu pourras utiliser pour sauver des vies, guérir les malades et même ressusciter les morts !
Maître, mais pour obtenir ces pouces, je devrais blesser et tuer des gens.
Je ne peux pas faire cela !
Ah, je vois que tu as menti.
Tu as dit que tu ferais tout ce que je demanderais, Ahimsaka.
Quelle importance cela aurait-il ?
Si tu réussis, tu pourras simplement ressusciter les gens que tu as tués.
Je suppose que tout le temps que j'ai investi en toi a été gaspillé.
Il est clair que tu n'es pas prêt à être diplômé.
Pense à ce que tes parents ressentiront quand tu rentreras à la maison en échec.
Mais maître, je ferais n'importe quoi d'autre si vous me le demandiez.
Vous ne voulez sûrement pas que j'aille dans le monde et fasse du mal à tant de gens.
C'est ton choix, Ahimsaka.
Le chemin est devant toi - soit tu l'acceptes, soit tu abandonnes et rentres chez toi en échec.
C'est ton choix.
Maître, vous ne m'avez jamais menti, ni ne m'avez jamais égaré.
Je vais vous faire confiance et faire ce que vous m'ordonnez.
Ahimsaka imagina toute la douleur et la souffrance qu'il causerait s'il entreprenait cette quête.
Mais ensuite, il pensa que s'il atteignait son but, il pourrait utiliser les connaissances et les pouvoirs acquis pour aider beaucoup de gens.
À contrecoeur, Ahimsaka se rendit dans la salle d'armes et rassembla l'équipement nécessaire pour sa quête.
À la satisfaction des étudiants jaloux, Ahimsaka dit au revoir à tout le monde et partit pour commencer son épreuve finale.
Ahimsaka se concentra sur la quête qui l'attendait.
Il pensa : Si je vais faire cela, je le ferai de toutes mes forces.
Je dois consacrer toute mon énergie et ma sagesse à accomplir cette tâche.
Ahimsaka partit pour la forêt et commença à traquer les criminels et les bandits.
Aucun d'eux n'avait la moindre chance.
Après ses premières morts, Ahimsaka fut secoué jusqu'au plus profond de lui-même.
Dans toute sa vie, il n'avait jamais intentionnellement fait de mal à un être vivant, encore moins ôté une vie.
Il avait vécu une vie aimante et bienveillante, ne souhaitant jamais de mal aux autres.
Pourtant, le voilà, couvert du sang des personnes dont il avait pris la vie.
En voyant le sang sur ses mains, Ahimsaka fit une crise.
Cependant, après un certain temps, Ahimsaka médita et retrouva sa concentration.
Il était maintenant trop tard pour faire demi-tour.
La seule voie possible était de terminer sa quête.
Il se dévoua aux tâches à accomplir et se dit qu'il pourrait pleurer après avoir terminé sa mission.
Ahimsaka cibla sans peur et avec férocité les bandits, voleurs, violeurs, meurtriers et autres criminels violents.
Quel que soit leur nombre, ils n'avaient aucune chance contre Ahimsaka.
Ahimsaka leur prélevait les pouces et les ajoutait à sa collection.
Il les transportait dans un sac, mais le sang dégoulinait partout et la chair en décomposition commençait à sentir.
Ahimsaka eut alors une idée.
Il enfilait les doigts ensemble et laissait les vautours et les animaux enlever toute la chair des os.
Après que les animaux eurent fini, il rassemblait les os et les faisait sécher au soleil.
Les doigts étaient vitaux pour le succès de sa quête ; pour ne pas les perdre, Ahimsaka les tissa en un collier qu'il commença à porter autour du cou en permanence.
Les gens qui le voyaient commencèrent à l'appeler Angulimala, ce qui signifie "Collier de Doigts".
Après avoir nettoyé la forêt de tous les criminels et bandits, Angulimala commença à s'attaquer à quiconque traversait la forêt.
Avec son adresse et sa concentration, personne n'avait la moindre chance.
Quiconque croisait son chemin ajoutait à sa collection de doigts.
Une prime substantielle fut mise sur la tête d'Angulimala, et beaucoup cherchèrent à la réclamer.
Cependant, ils ne réalisaient pas qu'en faisant cela, ils contribuaient au collier d'Angulimala.
La nouvelle d'Angulimala se répandit dans les villes et villages voisins.
Les gens, terrifiés, emballèrent ce qu'ils pouvaient porter et abandonnèrent leurs maisons.
Quand Angulimala arrivait dans une ville, tous ceux qui restaient devenaient ses cibles.
Angulimala anéantit de nombreux villages et villes de cette manière.
La nouvelle d'Angulimala voyagea rapidement et atteignit la capitale.
Même les soldats étaient terrifiés par lui.
Des rumeurs sur les meurtres vicieux commencèrent à circuler.
Les gens commencèrent à protester devant le palais royal, exigeant que le roi agisse.
Le roi Pasenadi appela son conseiller de confiance Bhaggava et lui demanda d'ordonner aux troupes de capturer ce bandit vicieux connu sous le nom d'Angulimala.
Le roi et Bhaggava n'étaient pas sûrs de pouvoir capturer ce tueur prolifique.
Bhaggava, éternellement loyal au roi, promit qu'il capturerait ce bandit.
Bhaggava proclama un décret royal qui ordonnait à tous les soldats et mercenaires de poursuivre Angulimala.
Quand Mantani, son épouse, entendit le décret, ses instincts maternels se réveillèrent.
Elle savait que ce meurtrier nommé Angulimala n'était autre que son fils.
Elle dit : Mon mari, je sens que cet Angulimala est notre fils, Ahimsaka.
Vous ne pouvez pas envoyer les soldats contre lui.
C'est notre fils !
S'il a fait ce qu'on dit qu'il a fait, alors qu'il soit capturé et exécuté.
Il n'est plus mon fils.
Non ! Ne dis pas ça ! C'est notre fils ! S'il te plaît ! Tu dois l'aider.
Après que ses supplications soient tombées dans l'oreille d'un sourd, Mantani, la mère d'Ahimsaka, se déguisa.
Elle quitta le palais à l'aube.
Ce même matin, comme chaque matin, le Bouddha étendit son oeil divin pour surveiller le monde entier, cherchant une personne prête et apte à recevoir son aide divine.
Le Bouddha vit que ce jour-là, Angulimala rencontrerait sa mère.
Jusqu'à ce moment, Angulimala avait cultivé assez de paramitas pour pouvoir atteindre l'éveil dans cette vie.
Cependant, si Angulimala tuait sa mère, il aurait commis l'un des cinq anantarika-kammas, actions haineuses qui bloquent toute chance d'éveil dans cette vie et mènent à une renaissance immédiate en enfer.
Les cinq anantarika-kammas incluent : Tuer intentionnellement sa mère, Tuer intentionnellement son père, Tuer un Arahant, Provoquer un schisme au sein du Sangha, la communauté des moines et nonnes.
Répandre le sang d'un Bouddha.
Si Angulimala commettait un Anantarika-kamma, l'ampleur de ce kamma l'empêcherait d'atteindre un quelconque stade d'éveil dans cette vie.
Après sa mort, il renaîtrait dans l'Avici Niraya, le niveau le plus bas de l'enfer.
Là, il passerait d'innombrables vies à endurer des tourments et des douleurs indicibles.
Chaque fois qu'il mourait en enfer, il se réincarnait au même endroit et était forcé de revivre les tourments et les souffrances.
Le Bouddha, dans sa compassion infinie pour la souffrance des âmes perdues, marcha jusqu'à l'endroit où Angulimala était sur le point de rencontrer sa mère.
Angulimala était perché dans un arbre de la forêt.
Il attendait un voyageur malchanceux sur lequel fondre.
Angulimala avait amassé 999 doigts.
Ce serait le doigt final nécessaire pour achever sa quête.
Angulimala vit une femme marchant sur le sentier vers lui.
La mère d'Angulimala, Mantani, tremblait de peur en marchant dans la forêt silencieuse.
Elle avait peur et voulait rentrer chez elle, mais son instinct maternel la poussa à continuer afin de sauver son fils.
Peu de temps après, avec sa bonne vue, Angulimala reconnut que la femme effrayée était sa mère.
Cependant, Angulimala pensa simplement : plus tôt je finirai cela, plus tôt je pourrai commencer à aider les gens avec la sagesse du parchemin.
Si ma mère doit fournir le millième doigt, qu'il en soit ainsi.
Je pourrai simplement la ressusciter après avoir achevé ma quête.
Cependant, Angulimala remarqua une autre personne sur le sentier marchant vers lui.
C'était un moine.
Étant donné le choix entre tuer sa mère ou le moine, Angulimala choisit facilement le moine.
Il était loin de se douter que le moine qu'il avait choisi pour cible n'était pas un moine ordinaire, mais le Seigneur Bouddha lui-même.
Angulimala sauta de son lieu de cachette, s'attendant à fendre sa cible d'un seul coup.
Cependant, quelque chose d'étrange se produisit.
Quelle que soit la vitesse à laquelle Angulimala courait ou ses efforts, il ne pouvait pas gagner de terrain ni se rapprocher du Bouddha.
En fait, plus il courait vite, plus la distance entre eux semblait grandir.
Cela secoua grandement Angulimala.
Dans le passé, il avait même pu rattraper les chevaux les plus rapides.
Comment un moine, qui ne faisait que marcher, pouvait-il être hors de sa portée ?
Angulimala cria : Moine, ARRÊTEZ-VOUS !
Le Bouddha, sans s'arrêter, dit : Angulimala, je me suis arrêté.
C'est toi qui ne t'es pas arrêté.
Angulimala cria : Moine !
C'est mal de mentir aussi effrontément.
N'importe qui peut voir que vous marchez et que donc vous ne vous êtes pas arrêté.
Je suis debout ici, il est évident que je me suis arrêté.
Comment pouvez-vous mentir aussi effrontément ?
Cela ne convient pas à un moine !
Le Bouddha dit alors : Angulimala, je me suis arrêté.
Je me suis arrêté de nuire aux autres.
J'ai arrêté tous mes désirs.
J'ai arrêté tous mes attachements.
Par conséquent, j'ai arrêté de créer du karma.
Par conséquent, j'ai arrêté toutes les futures renaissances.
Toi, cependant, tu ne t'es pas arrêté.
Tu continues à tuer et à nuire aux autres, ce qui mènera à un karma indésirable et à des renaissances.
Tu as garanti que tu auras de la souffrance devant toi.
C'est toi qui ne t'es pas arrêté.
La profondeur des paroles du Bouddha perça toute résistance qu'Angulimala avait.
C'était comme si le Bouddha parlait directement à son coeur.
Angulimala tomba à genoux, relâchant toute apparence de résistance.
Il sut alors et là que le moine devant lui n'était pas n'importe quel moine, mais le Seigneur Bouddha.
Angulimala leva les mains en signe de révérence.
Le Bouddha, voyant qu'Angulimala était prêt à recevoir son aide, dit : Angulimala, toutes les créatures en ce monde tiennent à leur vie.
Elles ne veulent pas être blessées.
Elles ne veulent pas mourir.
C'est une vérité universelle.
Tuer et nuire aux autres crée un karma indésirable.
Cela crée un contrat karmique pour lequel tu dois renaître dans des états de souffrance pour l'accomplir.
Mon seigneur, vous avez raison.
J'ai été stupide de penser que je pouvais tuer des gens pour les aider.
Mes actions n'ont causé que de la peine et de la souffrance, pour les autres et pour moi-même.
Je vois l'erreur de mes voies.
Je me repens, mon seigneur, je me repens.
S'il vous plaît, guidez-moi, enseignez-moi, soyez mon refuge hors des ténèbres.
Angulimala se leva et se débarrassa de toutes ses armes et outils de meurtre.
Il revint et se prosterna aux pieds du Bouddha.
S'il vous plaît, mon seigneur, acceptez-moi comme votre humble disciple.
Guidez-moi sur le chemin que vous avez gracieusement parcouru afin que je puisse suivre vos traces.
Et ainsi Angulimala devint un disciple du Bouddha.
Bientôt, Angulimala, le meurtrier de masse, fut ordonné moine sous le Bouddha.
À cette époque, le roi Pasenadi menait son armée pour chasser Angulimala.
Le roi décida de s'arrêter et de demander au Bouddha sa bénédiction avant sa chasse.
Grand roi, qu'est-ce qui vous amène ici aujourd'hui pour me voir ?
Mon seigneur Bouddha, il y a un meurtrier de masse qui terrorise mon peuple.
Ils exigent que je le capture et le traduise en justice.
Cependant, c'est un adversaire vicieux et puissant.
Je crains d'échouer.
Je suis venu demander votre bénédiction et vos conseils.
Grand roi des hommes, si vous deviez voir le meurtrier que vous cherchez, Angulimala, en tant que moine, et saviez qu'il a renoncé à toute violence et à tout mal, que feriez-vous ?
Vénérable Bouddha, si cela était vrai, je lui rendrais hommage, lui donnerais de la nourriture, lui offrirais une robe safran et prendrais soin de lui aussi longtemps qu'il resterait moine dans votre ordre.
C'est ce que je ferais.
Grand roi, ne cherchez plus.
Regardez là-bas.
Voici l'Angulimala que vous cherchez.
Le roi Pasenadi perdit sa pleine conscience une seconde et cria de peur : Angulimala !
C'est lui ? Angulimala ?
Cependant, le roi reprit rapidement son sang-froid et dit : Comment est-ce possible ?
Comment l'infâme Angulimala peut-il être assis devant moi en tant que moine ?
Angulimala dit alors : L'exalté Bouddha m'a montré l'erreur de mes vues.
J'ai renoncé à tout mal et je promets de ne faire que le bien.
Je suivrai tous les enseignements du Bouddha jusqu'à la fin de ma vie.
Le roi dit alors : Je respecte votre nouvelle vie et votre dévouement.
S'il vous plaît, revenez au palais avec moi et je vous construirai une belle kuti dans mon domaine.
De plus, veuillez accepter ces robes safran de ma part en cadeau.
Grand roi, je ne désire ni confort ni plaisirs.
Je me contente de n'avoir qu'un seul jeu de robes.
Je dormirai dans la forêt, sous le ciel ouvert.
Pour les repas, je ne mangerai que ce que je recevrai lors de mes tournées d'aumônes.
Mon seul désir maintenant est de pratiquer le Dhamma.
Le roi proclama alors : C'est vraiment merveilleux !
C'est vraiment splendide !
Le Bouddha est vraiment extraordinaire d'être capable de vaincre un tel Angulimala et de le conduire sur le droit chemin.
Je n'aurais jamais pensé possible que quelqu'un qui a fait autant de mal qu'Angulimala se repente et change de voie !
Quand les parents d'Angulimala entendirent la nouvelle du roi, ils se sentirent vraiment bienheureux de savoir que leur fils avait retrouvé le Juste Chemin.
La nouvelle vie d'Angulimala en tant que moine n'était pas facile.
Il devait descendre en ville pour mendier sa nourriture.
Quand les gens voyaient ses larges épaules et ses gros muscles, ils savaient que c'était Angulimala.
Ils fuyaient tous, terrorisés.
Pendant de nombreux jours, Angulimala resta affamé.
Cependant, il ne se plaignit pas, car il savait que c'était un très petit prix à payer pour ses péchés.
Certains jours, les villageois ne pouvaient contenir leur colère et leur haine.
Beaucoup d'entre eux avaient perdu des maris, des femmes, des filles, des fils, des pères et des mères entre les mains d'Angulimala.
Ils voyaient en cela leur opportunité de se venger.
Angulimala, cependant, ne se défendit pas.
Il les laissa le frapper et ne s'enfuit pas.
Certains villageois lui lancèrent des excréments et l'insultèrent.
Certains mirent des excréments dans son bol.
Certaines personnes brisèrent son bol.
Angulimala supporta tout cela.
Il ne parla jamais.
Il ne se défendit jamais ni ne s'enfuit.
Cependant, il était très triste.
Il savait que c'était le résultat de son mauvais karma et savait qu'il y en aurait beaucoup d'autres à venir.
Angulimala se demandait combien il serait difficile d'être bon.
Serait-il capable de le faire ?
Serait-il capable de réussir à rester sur le chemin vertueux ?
Les gens lui permettraient-ils de continuer sur ce chemin ?
Essayeraient-ils de se mettre en travers de son chemin ?
Une multitude de doutes et de désespoir remplirent son esprit.
Angulimala essuya les pensées négatives avec sa sagesse et sa détermination.
Il pensa : J'ai fait le mal, et les résultats ont été mis en mouvement.
Ma tâche n'est pas de me complaire dans la peur ou le désespoir, mais plutôt d'avancer et d'utiliser le reste de ma vie pour poursuivre l'éveil.
J'utiliserai mon passé comme motivation pour ne jamais reculer ou abandonner.
Chaque coup que je recevrai, chaque punition que j'endurerai, je la verrai comme un moyen de rembourser les dettes que je dois.
Je n'aurai aucune malveillance ou haine envers qui que ce soit, car cela ne ferait que prolonger ma souffrance.
Je ne me préoccuperai pas de ce qui pourrait arriver ou de ce qui pourrait se produire.
Je me préoccuperai seulement de penser de bonnes pensées qui mènent à l'éveil, de ne dire que de bonnes paroles qui ne nuisent pas, et de faire de bonnes actions qui mèneront à mon éveil.
Je n'abandonnerai pas, je ne ralentirai pas et je ne m'arrêterai pas.
Je dois réussir. C'est le seul moyen.
Angulimala était ferme dans son entraînement.
Il respectait les pratiques Dhutanga, qui incluaient de ne porter que des robes faites de chiffons jetés et de ne pas accepter de robes toutes faites des laïcs, de ne manger que la nourriture collectée lors du bindabhat ou des tournées d'aumônes et de ne pas accepter de nourriture dans un vihara ou sur invitation dans la maison d'un laïc, et de vivre sous un arbre sans l'abri d'un toit.
Ces pratiques renforcèrent son dévouement et son aversion pour les renaissances possibles dans ce monde.
Un jour, Angulimala vit une femme qui avait de sévères douleurs à l'accouchement.
Il ressentit une grande karuna, ou empathie, pour elle.
Il voulait l'aider mais il ne savait pas ce qu'il pouvait faire.
Il pensa : Il y a tant de souffrance dans ce monde.
Les êtres humains souffrent tellement.
Angulimala alla demander conseil au Bouddha.
Il dit : Très vénérable Seigneur Bouddha, que puis-je faire pour aider ?
Le Bouddha dit : Dites-lui, 'Soeur, depuis ma naissance, je n'ai jamais intentionnellement pris une vie.
Par cette vérité, puissiez-vous et l'enfant être en sécurité !' Mon seigneur, je ne peux pas sciemment mentir.
J'ai déjà pris de nombreuses vies.
Angulimala, utilise ta sagesse.
Dis-lui : 'Soeur, depuis que je suis né dans la noble naissance, je n'ai jamais intentionnellement pris une vie.
Par cette vérité, puissiez-vous et l'enfant être en sécurité !'' Angulimala trouva les paroles du Bouddha très éclairantes.
Depuis qu'il est né dans la noble naissance, c'est-à-dire depuis qu'il a été ordonné moine, il n'a jamais intentionnellement pris une vie.
Il était confiant dans la validité de cette vérité.
Angulimala fit savoir qu'il irait rendre visite à la femme enceinte.
Les gens sur place installèrent un rideau dans la chambre de la femme enceinte et préparèrent un siège pour Angulimala.
Angulimala s'assit, concentra son esprit et fit l'affirmation de vérité, ou *sacca adhitthana*, comme le Bouddha le lui avait enseigné.
Étonnamment, après qu'Angulimala eut fait son affirmation de vérité, le bébé naquit facilement et la mère ne ressentit aucune douleur.
Toutes les femmes furent stupéfaites.
Ce moine, par son affirmation de vérité, avait rendu un accouchement difficile sûr et facile.
La mère reconnaissante répandit la nouvelle et de nombreuses autres femmes enceintes demandèrent l'aide d'Angulimala.
Dans de nombreux cas, lorsque des personnes en colère et vindicatives s'en prenaient à Angulimala, les femmes qu'il avait aidées intervenaient en sa faveur.
Elles parlaient de ses bonnes actions et demandaient de suspendre leur jugement et leur colère jusqu'à ce qu'il ait aidé les autres femmes enceintes.
La vie d'Angulimala s'améliora, mais était loin d'être facile.
Il était encore souvent attaqué et subissait de nombreuses blessures.
Un jour, après une bastonnade, il alla voir le Bouddha.
Mon seigneur, la quête du bien n'est pas facile.
Il y a tant d'obstacles sur mon chemin.
Rien que recevoir les résultats karmiques de mes actions passées est très difficile à supporter.
Angulimala, supporte-les ! Supporte-les !
Tu expérimentes ici et maintenant la maturation de ton karma, que tu aurais pu expérimenter sur une année, de nombreux siècles, ou de nombreux millénaires.
Lorsque l'on aspire à la libération finale en une seule vie, les karmas passés mûrissent généralement plus rapidement dans cette vie.
Supporte, car nous avons déjà créé les causes, donc les résultats sont inévitables.
Utilise le temps qu'il te reste dans cette vie pour atteindre la pleine libération.
Ne te concentre pas sur ce qui est inévitable, car cela gaspillerait ton temps.
Concentre-toi sur ce que tu peux accomplir et va de l'avant de toutes tes forces pour l'atteindre.
Angulimala laissa les paroles du Bouddha s'imprimer dans son esprit.
Il pensa à la façon dont tous les êtres qui causent du tort et de la souffrance à d'autres finissent toujours par souffrir à cause de leurs actions.
Toutes les actions mauvaises ont pour conséquence des naissances indésirables.
Angulimala contempla la souffrance inhérente à la vie.
Comparé à toute la souffrance à laquelle les êtres vivants sont soumis, quel bonheur en vaut la peine ?
De combien de bonheur aurions-nous besoin pour que la multitude de souffrances que nous expérimentons en vaille la peine ?
Qu'y a-t-il dans la vie qui vaille la peine de souffrir de la mort ?
Rien dans la vie n'est permanent ; par conséquent, aucun bonheur ne restera avec nous.
Cependant, les résultats de nos actions restent avec nous jusqu'à ce qu'ils soient payés.
Lorsque nous ressentons de la douleur, les autres qui tiennent à nous souffrent aussi.
Lorsque d'autres dont nous nous soucions souffrent, nous souffrons aussi.
La vie est un cycle sans fin de souffrance.
Angulimala se remémora toutes les expériences de sa vie.
Il réfléchit à toute la souffrance qu'il avait causée, toute la souffrance qu'il avait vécue et toute la souffrance qu'il allait endurer.
Son esprit, après avoir été confronté à d'innombrables expériences traumatisantes de souffrance, libéra tous les attachements.
Une fois que son esprit eut libéré tous les attachements, rien ne put le convaincre de renaître jamais plus dans aucun royaume, ce qui lui fit atteindre la pleine illumination en tant que libéré, un Arahant.
Interrogé par les moines sur la raison pour laquelle Angulimala avait tué 999 personnes, le Bouddha raconta une histoire du passé.
Il y a très longtemps, Angulimala était né comme une tortue géante de la taille d'une maison.
Il était gentil et aidait souvent les voyageurs en mer dans le besoin.
Il y avait un groupe de pêcheurs qui avaient loué un navire pour vendre leurs biens et marchandises dans la ville portuaire.
Lors de ce voyage particulier, les pêcheurs purent vendre tous leurs biens rapidement.
Voyant qu'il était encore tôt dans la journée, ils décidèrent de dépenser une partie de leur argent pour boire et festoyer.
Cependant, comme c'est souvent le cas avec l'alcool, les pêcheurs perdirent la notion du temps et burent jusqu'à la nuit.
Ils ne retournèrent à la mer qu'au coucher du soleil.
Pendant leur voyage, ils rencontrèrent des vents violents et des vagues massives.
Finalement, le navire fut détruit et les pêcheurs se retrouvèrent accrochés à des débris flottants pour survivre.
Au loin, les pêcheurs naufragés virent une tortue gigantesque de la taille d'une maison.
Ils agitèrent les bras et crièrent pour que la tortue vienne les sauver.
La tortue vit les humains naufragés et ressentit de la compassion pour eux.
Bien qu'il pût voir qu'ils avaient bu et qu'il ne leur faisait pas confiance, sa compassion surpassa ses réticences et il décida de les aider.
La tortue dit : Pêcheurs, je vois que vous avez besoin d'aide.
Je peux vous apporter cette aide.
Mais j'ai entendu parler de la méchanceté et de la violence de l'homme ; comment puis-je être assuré de ma sécurité si je vous sauve ?
Grande tortue, n'aie crainte !
Nous sommes des maris et des pères aimants qui souhaitons simplement rentrer chez nous auprès de nos femmes et de nos enfants.
Si nous périssons, qui les nourrira ?
Qui les protégera ?
Pensez aux femmes !
Pensez aux enfants, grande tortue !
Je pense à vos femmes et à vos enfants, mais vous devez d'abord jurer qu'aucun mal ne m'arrivera si je vous sauve.
Grande tortue compatissante, nous jurons sur tout ce qui est saint et sacré qu'aucun mal ne te sera fait par nos mains.
Et ainsi, la tortue nagea plus près et fit monter tous les survivants sur son dos.
La tortue nagea ensuite l'énorme distance jusqu'au village des pêcheurs.
Lorsqu'ils arrivèrent chez eux, la tortue géante se positionna sur la plage pour que les pêcheurs puissent débarquer.
Maintenant qu'ils ne craignaient plus pour leur survie, les pêcheurs pensèrent aux biens qu'ils avaient perdus et à la perte nette que représentait ce voyage pour eux.
Ils ne virent plus la tortue comme un sauveur, mais comme une marchandise précieuse dont ils pourraient tirer profit.
Les tortues géantes étaient considérées comme des animaux sacrés en raison de leur longue vie et leur viande était très demandée.
Les gens croyaient que si l'on mangeait la viande d'une tortue géante, on serait récompensé par une longue vie.
Tous les pêcheurs et villageois convinrent que c'était une opportunité à ne pas gaspiller.
Mais dans tout le village, il y avait une jeune fille qui savait dans son coeur que c'était mal.
Cette tortue avait sauvé son peuple et ne méritait pas ce qu'ils prévoyaient.
Elle eut pitié de la tortue, mais ne savait pas quoi faire.
Les pêcheurs traîtres capturèrent violemment la tortue compatissante qui les avait sauvés.
Ils attachèrent des cordes autour de son corps et de sa tête.
Tout le village travailla ensemble pour capturer la tortue géante.
Puis, oubliant leur gratitude, ils assassinèrent sauvagement la tortue géante.
La tortue géante mourut dans l'agonie et ressentit la piqûre de la trahison submerger son coeur.
Les pêcheurs organisèrent un grand festin pour célébrer leur prise massive.
Le corps de la tortue nourrirait leur village pendant de nombreux mois et la viande de tortue rapporterait un bon prix.
Les pêcheurs grillèrent une partie de la viande de tortue pour le festin.
La seule personne qui ne mangea pas la viande fut la petite fille qui avait eu pitié de la gentille tortue.
Ils étaient loin de se douter que l'esprit de la tortue les observait.
La tortue pensa : Je vous ai aidés lorsque vous étiez au bord de la mort.
J'ai travaillé dur pour assurer votre survie.
Vous avez fait un serment que vous avez rompu sans aucune hésitation.
Tout comme vous m'avez fait une promesse, je vais vous en faire une, et je la tiendrai.
Je ne vous pardonnerai jamais.
Je reviendrai dans une vie future et prendrai toutes vos vies, tout comme vous avez pris la mienne.
Quoi qu'il en coûte, j'aurai ma vengeance. Je le jure !
Et ainsi, la tortue finit par renaître en tant que le meurtrier Angulimala.
Les 999 victimes étaient les 999 personnes qui avaient mangé la viande de la tortue.
La petite fille renaquit plus tard en tant que Mantani, la mère d'Ahimsaka.
Puisqu'elle n'avait pas mangé la viande de la tortue, elle fut épargnée.
