var textSt = `THE AXE, THE DRUM, THE BOWL, AND THE DIAMOND
Once upon a time there was a poor young man who went out into the world to seek his fortune.
He went aboard a ship sailing across the ocean; and after they had sailed for a year and a day, suddenly a great storm arose.
The rain descended, and the wind blew, and it blew so hard and so wild, that the ship went miles out of her course, and the skipper could not tell where they were.
And then, in the middle of the night, a great crash came, and the ship was dashed upon a reef.
The waves beat and battered it, and turned it topsy-turvy, and the end of it was that every soul was drowned except the poor young man.
The waves washed him ashore, more dead than alive, and on the shore he lay till next morning, when the sun warmed him and woke him up from his faint.
He got up and looked about him, and wandered over the place, which he found was an island.
It did not take him long to walk round it; and then he saw that it was a small island, and far as the eye could reach not another speck of land was to be seen.
There were plenty of trees growing in the island, with fruit and flowers, bananas and cocoanuts, and springs of water; but on the trees were no birds, and no animals ran about on the ground.
So he lived on the fruits and roots, and did the best he could.
One day, to his great surprise, he saw a black thing in the sky; and, still more surprising, the black thing had no wings.
Yet it was flying, and flew nearer and nearer, until he saw that it was a large wild pig.
How could a pig fly through the air?
He rubbed his eyes and looked again; yes, a pig it was beyond all doubt; and it flew closer and closer until it came to the island.
He hid behind a bush, and saw the pig sink slowly to the ground and lie down under a tree.
Soon the pig was fast asleep and snoring.
He went up close, and, to his amazement, by the pig's side, was the most magnificent diamond he ever saw.
It blazed and sparkled in the sun and looked like a ball of fire.
He stepped gingerly up to the pig, and took hold of the diamond; the pig was very sleepy and snored away heartily.
As he turned the diamond about in his hand and saw it flash, he suddenly thought to himself, "What if the pig should wake? He looks fierce, he has great sharp tusks, and I have nothing to defend myself with. If I were only up in that tree, now----" But what on earth had happened?
As the thought came into his mind, he found himself perched in the tree-top.
For a little while he was quite dazed and dizzy.
Then he began to wonder if it could be the diamond which had done this miracle.
So just to try, he wished himself down again; and there he was, without knowing how!
He began to understand that this was a magic diamond, and something which he must take great care of.
Then he wished himself up in the tree again.
When he was in the tree once more, he picked off a nut that was growing on the tree, and dropped it upon the pig's nose.
The pig woke up, raised his head, and looked round for the diamond; he was a very intelligent pig, indeed he was really not a pig at all, but a great magician, who used to fly about in the shape of a pig because he was as wicked as could be, and preferred being a pig rather than a man.
There are really a great many people like that, only we see them in the shape of men and do not know the difference.
Now when this pig saw that his diamond was gone, he fell in a fury; for all his power lay in the diamond, and without it he was nothing more than any other pig.
So he glared and snorted, and looked all round, and down, and up--and then he saw the man who had dropped the nut upon his snout!
Then his fury knew no bounds; he foamed at the mouth, and ran raging round and round the tree; but the man only laughed, and dropped more nuts on him.
This made him mad indeed, for pigs cannot climb trees, and he saw that his diamond was lost, and with it all his magical power; so in his madness he charged straight at the tree, and ran his tusks right into the trunk.
There they stuck, and tug as he would, he could not get them out.
The man wished himself down from the tree, and looked about for a large stone, with which he battered the pig's skull till it was dead.
Then he held the diamond over the pig, so that the sun's rays shone down and were reflected through it; and so fine and strong was the diamond, that in a very short time a delicious smell of roast pork rose to his nostrils, and the whole pig was done to a turn, with rich crisp crackling.
Then he took a sharp shell which he found lying on the beach, and carved off slices of the pork, which he ate.
It was very nice indeed, and he had the best meal he had enjoyed since the ship had been wrecked on the reef, and he had been cast ashore on that island.
By-and-by, when he had finished his dinner, it occurred to him that as the pig had flown there through the air, so he might fly away.
So holding his diamond in his hand, he wished to fly through the air to the nearest land.
Then he felt himself rising, and he was carried swiftly through the air, and away, away over the sea; the island grew smaller, it became a black patch, it dwindled to a speck in the distance.
The sun shone warm upon him, the waves sparkled underneath; porpoises gambolled about, playing leap-frog in the sea; flying-fish came out of the water in a flash of light, and dropped into the water again; still he went on, till, as the sun was setting, he came close to a sandy beach; and there before long he stood, wondering what he should do next.
He looked round, and not far off, behind a clump of bushes, rose a thin column of smoke.
He put the diamond in his pocket, and walked towards the smoke.
Soon he saw a queer little hut, and at the door, upon the ground, sat a man without any legs.
Whether a shark had bitten off his legs, or whether he never had any, I cannot tell you, for he never told me; but there he sat, like a chessman.
He had a fur cap, and a fur coat; he did not need any trousers, for he had no legs to put them on, as I have told you.
In front of him was a fire, and over the fire was a spit, and on the spit was a young kid roasting.
"Good evening, sir," said the young man.
"Good evening," said the other.
"Can you give me a night's shelter?" the young man asked.
"Whatever I have, you may share," said the old man with no legs.
So they sat down, and ate a good meal; but the young man was rather frightened to see that the other man ate skin, and bones, and everything.
And he did not like the way the old man eyed him.
In fact I must tell you, that this old man was another magician, and a friend of the magician who looked like a pig; and when any travellers came that way, he used to eat them.
He did not eat this traveller, because the kid was ready roasted; but he meant to do it as soon as he should be hungry again.
"How did you get here?" asked the old man.
"I flew over the sea," said the young man.
"Indeed!" said the old man.
"And how did you manage that?"
Then the traveller showed his diamond, and told the old man what a wonderful stone it was, and how it gave any one power to fly through the air.
"If you will give me your diamond," said the old man, "I will give you my axe. You see I have no legs, so you may wonder how I live."
"This is the way I live."
"If I slap this axe on the handle, and say, Wood and fire! away it flies, and cuts wood and kindles a fire."
"If I slap the steel, and say, Heads! away it flies, and chops off the head of a goat or any animal I want; and then it brings me meat for my dinner."
"Now I have lived here for a thousand years by the help of my axe, and I am rather tired of being in one place."
"I should like to see the world before I die, and that is why I want your diamond."
"All right," said the young man, "it's a bargain."
They exchanged the axe and the diamond;
the old man turned it over in his hand, chuckling greedily.
As soon as the young man got grip of the axe, he smacked the steel, and says he, "Heads!" In a jiffy the axe sliced through the old man's neck like a turnip, and he had no more head than legs.
Then the traveller picked up the diamond, and put it in his pocket.
So now he had two magic things instead of one.
He blessed his luck, and fell asleep very happily inside the old magician's hut.
Next morning, with the diamond in his pocket and the axe on his shoulder, the young man set out on his travels.
All day long he walked through the forest, until at evening time he saw before him another hut, like the first, where lived the old man with no legs.
Before this hut, too, there was a fire burning, and beside the fire sat an old man without any arms.
Whether a tiger had bitten off his arms or whether he never had any, I cannot say, because he never told me; but there he sat like a pair of compasses.
He had the stump of a tree to sit on, and before him was another stump, and on this stump was a large bowl of milk, out of which he was drinking.
When he saw our friend, he tipped over this bowl with his chin; instantly a deep roaring river surrounded him and his hut, and he sat in the middle, laughing at the young man's surprise.
But he did not laugh long, for the young man instantly wished himself over the river, and there he was.
Now it was his turn to laugh.
"How on earth did you do that?"
asked the old man.
He was much too astonished to think of saying good-day.
"Oh, that's nothing," said the young man, and showed him his diamond.
The old man's eyes glistened.
He thought how nice it would be to have that diamond.
"What do you say to selling me that diamond?" said he.
"What will you give me for it?" asked the young man.
"I will give you this bowl. It is a wishing bowl."
"Whenever you are hungry all you have to do is to wish for something in it, and there it is"
"Milk, or soup, or wine; anything that can go in a bowl."
"And if you turn it over, as you saw me do just now, a rushing, roaring river pours out, and surrounds you, or, if you like, it will flood a whole country and drown every living thing."
"Dear me!" said the young man, "that is a wonderful bowl. Well, I agree; I'll give you my diamond for it."
So they exchanged the bowl and the diamond.
The old man took the diamond in his hand and watched it sparkle; but he did not watch long, for the young man slapped his hatchet and cried, "Heads!" In a jiffy the steel sliced through the old man's neck like a cucumber, and he had no more head than arms.
Then the young man picked up his diamond and put it away in his pocket.
So now he had three wonderful things instead of two.
He blessed his good luck, wished for some delicious wine in his bowl, drank it, and went to sleep happily, in the old man's hut.
Next morning the young man was up betimes; and after taking a meal out of his wishing-bowl, he set out once more to walk through the forest.
After he had walked for some hours, he heard, far in the distance, a loud rub-a-dub-dub, rub-a-dub-dub, boom, boom, boom.
He felt as if he could hardly help running away; still, with a great effort, he began to walk towards the sound, which got louder and louder every minute, till at last it made a tremendous din.
Then, suddenly, just as he came upon a little open glade in the forest, he heard a rustle, bustle, jostle, and out of the trees came a great herd of elephants, lions, tigers, wolves, and all sorts of wild animals, their hair bristling with fright, and every one of them tearing along at full speed.
They were far too much terrified to notice him, and, scurrying across the glade, they vanished among the trees.
By this time the noise had ceased, but it was not long before he came upon another little glade, and at the end of the glade was a hut, and in front of that hut sat a big black giant with a drum.
"Good day to you!" roared the giant, in a great voice.
"Good day!" said the young man, rather frightened.
"Come and have something to eat!" roared the giant.
"Thank you," said the young man.
They sat down, and the giant offered him some food.
But the young man thought it was safer not to take any of the giant's food, so he pulled out his bowl, and wished for some soup, and sipped it.
"What is that?" asked the giant.
The young man told him it was a wishing bowl, that gave any food he wanted.
The giant was very much delighted with the wishing bowl, and thought that if he could get that bowl, he would be able to eat without the trouble of getting things.
"I'll buy that bowl!" he roared.
"What will you give me for it?" asked the young man.
"I will give you this drum," said the giant.
"If you beat on one side, everybody that hears it will run away."
"Ah, that was why the lions and tigers were running away just now!" said the young man.
"Yes," said the giant.
"And if you beat on the other side, a splendid army of soldiers and horses will spring up out of the ground and defend you."
"All right, here you are," said the young man, and gave him the bowl.
The giant took the bowl in great glee, and horrid to tell, wished out loud for a bowlful of blood!
He began to drink it, but he did not finish; for as he buried his nose in the bowl, the young man slapped his axe, and said--"Heads!" Down came the axe with a crash on the giant's head, and cut it clean in two!
If the young man was glad when he saw the giant's head cleft in two, he was gladder when he went inside the giant's hut.
For there, all round the wall, were the bodies of travellers who had passed that way; and they were tied to the uprights of the wall, and their bodies were dry as dust, and shrivelled like a medlar.
For this giant used to catch all travellers and tie them up in his house, and then he sucked their blood till they were dry.
So when our traveller saw what a narrow escape he had had, he determined no longer to remain in that dreadful place.
Picking up the bowl and the drum, and feeling to see that his axe and diamond were safe, he wished himself at the gate of the nearest city.
Now the king of this city was a very cruel king.
He used to rob and murder even his own subjects; and as for strangers, he had short shrift and no mercy for them.
So when the king heard that there was a stranger outside the gates, he made up his mind to have some sport; and sent out a company of soldiers to fetch him in.
The young man beat his drum, and they all took to their heels!
You may imagine how angry the king was to hear this; he had all their heads chopped off on the spot, and sent a regiment.
The same thing happened to the regiment.
But this only made the king angrier than ever.
He ordered all his army to be marshalled before the gates, and himself riding at their head, led them forward to capture this audacious stranger.
Then the young man tipped over his wishing bowl.
Out poured a roaring torrent of water that flooded the plain, and drowned every soldier in the army, all except the king, who had galloped back to the city, and got up on the wall.
Then the young man slapped his axe, and cried, "Heads! I want the king's head!" Off flew the axe through the air like a boomerang, and sliced off the king's head, and brought it back to its master.
The people inside the city began to cheer with joy, when they saw the king with his head off.
And when the axe came back, the young man beat upon the other side of his drum; and lo and behold!
the earth began to tremble, it seemed full of holes, and from every hole sprouted a warrior fully armed.
Surrounded by his army, he marched into the city, where he became king, and lived happily ever after.
And I hope that we may be half as happy as he was.

EL HACHO, EL TAMBOR, EL BOL Y EL DIAMANTE
Érase una vez un joven pobre que salió al mundo en busca de su fortuna.
Subió a bordo de un barco que navegaba por el océano; y después de haber navegado durante un año y un día, de repente se desató una gran tormenta.
La lluvia cayó, y el viento sopló, y sopló tan fuerte y tan salvajemente, que el barco se desvió millas de su rumbo, y el capitán no podía decir dónde estaban.
Y entonces, en medio de la noche, se escuchó un gran estruendo, y el barco se estrelló contra un arrecife.
Las olas golpearon y golpearon, y lo voltearon, y al final, cada alma se ahogó excepto el pobre joven.
Las olas lo llevaron a la orilla, más muerto que vivo, y en la playa yació hasta la mañana siguiente, cuando el sol lo calentó y lo despertó de su desmayo.
Se levantó y miró a su alrededor, y recorrió el lugar, que descubrió que era una isla.
No le tomó mucho tiempo caminar alrededor; y luego vio que era una pequeña isla, y tan lejos como la vista podía alcanzar no había otro pedazo de tierra a la vista.
Había muchos árboles creciendo en la isla, con frutas y flores, plátanos y cocos, y manantiales de agua; pero en los árboles no había pájaros, y ningún animal corría por el suelo.
Así que vivió de las frutas y raíces, y hizo lo mejor que pudo.
Un día, para su gran sorpresa, vio una cosa negra en el cielo; y, aún más sorprendente, la cosa negra no tenía alas.
Sin embargo, estaba volando, y voló cada vez más cerca, hasta que vio que era un gran cerdo salvaje.
¿Cómo podía un cerdo volar por el aire?
Se frotó los ojos y miró de nuevo; sí, era un cerdo sin lugar a dudas; y voló cada vez más cerca hasta que llegó a la isla.
Se escondió detrás de un arbusto y vio al cerdo descender lentamente al suelo y acostarse bajo un árbol.
Pronto el cerdo estaba profundamente dormido y roncando.
Se acercó, y, para su asombro, al lado del cerdo, estaba el diamante más magnífico que jamás había visto.
Brillaba y centelleaba al sol y parecía una bola de fuego.
Se acercó con cuidado al cerdo y tomó el diamante; el cerdo estaba muy somnoliento y roncaba con ganas.
Mientras giraba el diamante en su mano y lo veía brillar, de repente pensó para sí mismo: "¿Y si el cerdo se despierta? Se ve feroz, tiene grandes colmillos afilados, y no tengo nada con qué defenderme. Ojalá estuviera en ese árbol, ahora----" Pero, ¿qué demonios había pasado?
Cuando el pensamiento llegó a su mente, se encontró posado en la cima del árbol.
Por un momento estuvo bastante aturdido y mareado.
Luego comenzó a preguntarse si podría ser el diamante el que había hecho este milagro.
Así que, solo para probar, deseó volver a bajar; y allí estaba, sin saber cómo.
Comenzó a entender que este era un diamante mágico, y algo de lo que debía cuidar mucho.
Luego deseó estar de nuevo en el árbol.
Cuando estuvo en el árbol una vez más, recogió una nuez que crecía en el árbol y la dejó caer sobre la nariz del cerdo.
El cerdo se despertó, levantó la cabeza y miró alrededor en busca del diamante; era un cerdo muy inteligente, de hecho, realmente no era un cerdo en absoluto, sino un gran mago, que solía volar en forma de cerdo porque era tan malvado como podía ser, y prefería ser un cerdo en lugar de un hombre.
Realmente hay muchas personas así, solo que las vemos en forma de hombres y no conocemos la diferencia.
Ahora, cuando este cerdo vio que su diamante había desaparecido, se enfureció; porque todo su poder residía en el diamante, y sin él no era más que cualquier otro cerdo.
Así que miró con furia y resopló, y miró a su alrededor, hacia abajo y hacia arriba--y luego vio al hombre que había dejado caer la nuez sobre su hocico.
Entonces su furia no conoció límites; babeaba de rabia y corría furioso alrededor del árbol; pero el hombre solo se rió y le dejó caer más nueces.
Esto lo volvió realmente loco, porque los cerdos no pueden trepar árboles, y vio que su diamante estaba perdido, y con él todo su poder mágico; así que, en su locura, embistió directamente contra el árbol y clavó sus colmillos en el tronco.
Allí se quedaron atascados, y por más que tirara, no pudo sacarlos.
El hombre deseó bajar del árbol y buscó una piedra grande, con la que golpeó el cráneo del cerdo hasta matarlo.
Luego sostuvo el diamante sobre el cerdo, de modo que los rayos del sol brillaran y se reflejaran a través de él; y tan fino y fuerte era el diamante, que en muy poco tiempo un delicioso olor a cerdo asado llegó a sus fosas nasales, y todo el cerdo estaba perfectamente cocido, con una rica y crujiente corteza.
Luego tomó una concha afilada que encontró en la playa y cortó rebanadas de cerdo asado, que comió.
Era realmente muy agradable, y tuvo la mejor comida que había disfrutado desde que el barco se había hundido en el arrecife y había sido arrojado a esa isla.
Poco a poco, cuando terminó su cena, se le ocurrió que así como el cerdo había volado allí a través del aire, él también podría volar lejos.
Así que, sosteniendo su diamante en la mano, deseó volar por el aire hacia la tierra más cercana.
Entonces sintió que se elevaba, y fue llevado rápidamente por el aire, lejos, lejos sobre el mar; la isla se hacía más pequeña, se convirtió en una mancha negra, se redujo a un punto en la distancia.
El sol brillaba cálido sobre él, las olas centelleaban debajo; los delfines saltaban, jugando a la rayuela en el mar; los peces voladores salían del agua en un destello de luz y volvían a caer en el agua; aún así continuó, hasta que, al ponerse el sol, se acercó a una playa de arena; y allí, poco después, se encontró, preguntándose qué debería hacer a continuación.
Miró a su alrededor, y no muy lejos, detrás de un grupo de arbustos, se alzaba una delgada columna de humo.
Metió el diamante en su bolsillo y caminó hacia el humo.
Pronto vio una extraña cabaña, y en la puerta, en el suelo, estaba sentado un hombre sin piernas.
No sé si un tiburón le había mordido las piernas, o si nunca había tenido, porque él nunca me lo dijo; pero allí estaba, como una pieza de ajedrez.
Tenía un gorro de piel y un abrigo de piel; no necesitaba pantalones, porque no tenía piernas para ponérselos, como ya te he contado.
Delante de él había un fuego, y sobre el fuego había un asador, y en el asador había un cabrito joven asándose.
"Buenas tardes, señor," dijo el joven.
"Buenas tardes," respondió el otro.
"¿Puede darme refugio por una noche?" preguntó el joven.
"Lo que tengo, puedes compartirlo," dijo el anciano sin piernas.
Así que se sentaron y comieron una buena comida; pero el joven estaba bastante asustado al ver que el otro hombre comía piel, huesos y todo.
Y no le gustaba la forma en que el anciano lo miraba.
De hecho, debo decirte que este anciano era otro mago, y amigo del mago que parecía un cerdo; y cuando algún viajero pasaba por allí, solía comérselos.
No se comió a este viajero, porque el cabrito estaba listo para asarse; pero tenía la intención de hacerlo tan pronto como tuviera hambre de nuevo.
"¿Cómo llegaste aquí?" preguntó el anciano.
"Volé sobre el mar," dijo el joven.
"¿De veras?" dijo el anciano.
"¿Y cómo lograste eso?"  
Entonces el viajero mostró su diamante y le dijo al anciano qué piedra tan maravillosa era, y cómo le daba a cualquiera el poder de volar por el aire.  
"Si me das tu diamante," dijo el anciano, "te daré mi hacha. Verás, no tengo piernas, así que te preguntarás cómo vivo."  
"Así es como vivo."  
"Si golpeo esta hacha en el mango y digo, ¡Madera y fuego! se va volando y corta madera y enciende un fuego."  
"Si golpeo el acero y digo, ¡Cabezas! se va volando y le corta la cabeza a una cabra o a cualquier animal que quiera; y luego me trae carne para mi cena."  
"Ahora he vivido aquí durante mil años con la ayuda de mi hacha, y estoy bastante cansado de estar en un solo lugar."  
"Me gustaría ver el mundo antes de morir, y por eso quiero tu diamante."  
"Está bien," dijo el joven, "es un trato."  
Intercambiaron el hacha y el diamante;  
el anciano lo giró en su mano, riendo codiciosamente.  
Tan pronto como el joven tomó el hacha, golpeó el acero y dijo, "¡Cabezas!" En un instante, el hacha cortó el cuello del anciano como si fuera un nabo, y no tuvo más cabeza que piernas.  
Luego el viajero recogió el diamante y lo metió en su bolsillo.  
Así que ahora tenía dos cosas mágicas en lugar de una.  
Bendijo su suerte y se quedó dormido muy feliz dentro de la cabaña del viejo mago.  
A la mañana siguiente, con el diamante en su bolsillo y el hacha en su hombro, el joven partió en sus viajes.  
Todo el día caminó por el bosque, hasta que al caer la tarde vio ante él otra cabaña, como la primera, donde vivía el anciano sin piernas.  
Delante de esta cabaña también había un fuego ardiendo, y junto al fuego estaba un anciano sin brazos.  
No sé si un tigre le había mordido los brazos o si nunca había tenido ninguno, porque nunca me lo dijo; pero allí estaba sentado como un par de compases.  
Tenía el tocón de un árbol para sentarse, y delante de él había otro tocón, y sobre este tocón había un gran cuenco de leche, del cual estaba bebiendo.
Cuando vio a nuestro amigo, volcó este cuenco con su barbilla; instantáneamente un profundo río rugiente lo rodeó a él y a su cabaña, y se sentó en el medio, riéndose de la sorpresa del joven.
Pero no se rió mucho, porque el joven instantáneamente deseó estar al otro lado del río, y allí estaba.
Ahora era su turno de reír.
"¿Cómo demonios hiciste eso?" 
preguntó el anciano.
Estaba demasiado asombrado para pensar en decir buenos días.
"Oh, eso no es nada," dijo el joven, y le mostró su diamante.
Los ojos del anciano brillaron.
Pensó en lo bonito que sería tener ese diamante.
"¿Qué te parece si me vendes ese diamante?" dijo él.
"¿Qué me darás por él?" preguntó el joven.
"Te daré este cuenco. Es un cuenco de deseos."
"Siempre que tengas hambre, solo tienes que desear algo en él, y ahí está."
"Leche, o sopa, o vino; cualquier cosa que pueda ir en un cuenco."
"Y si lo vuelcas, como me viste hacer hace un momento, un río rugiente y caudaloso sale y te rodea, o, si lo prefieres, inundará todo un país y ahogará a todo ser viviente."
"¡Dios mío!" dijo el joven, "ese es un cuenco maravilloso. Bueno, estoy de acuerdo; te daré mi diamante por él."
Así que intercambiaron el cuenco y el diamante.
El anciano tomó el diamante en su mano y lo observó brillar; pero no lo miró mucho tiempo, porque el joven golpeó su hacha y gritó, "¡Cabezas!" En un instante el acero cortó el cuello del anciano como si fuera un pepino, y ya no tenía más cabeza que brazos.
Entonces el joven recogió su diamante y lo guardó en su bolsillo.
Así que ahora tenía tres cosas maravillosas en lugar de dos.
Bendijo su buena suerte, deseó un delicioso vino en su cuenco, lo bebió y se fue a dormir felizmente en la cabaña del anciano.
A la mañana siguiente, el joven se levantó temprano; y después de tomar una comida de su cuenco de deseos, salió una vez más a caminar por el bosque.
Después de haber caminado durante algunas horas, escuchó, a lo lejos, un fuerte rub-a-dub-dub, rub-a-dub-dub, boom, boom, boom.
Sintió como si apenas pudiera evitar correr, sin embargo, con un gran esfuerzo, comenzó a caminar hacia el sonido, que se hacía más fuerte cada minuto, hasta que al final hizo un tremendo estruendo.
Entonces, de repente, justo cuando llegó a un pequeño claro en el bosque, escuchó un susurro, bullicio, empujones, y de entre los árboles salió una gran manada de elefantes, leones, tigres, lobos y todo tipo de animales salvajes, con el pelo erizado de miedo, y cada uno de ellos corriendo a toda velocidad.
Estaban demasiado aterrorizados para notarlo, y, apresurándose a través del claro, desaparecieron entre los árboles.
Para entonces, el ruido había cesado, pero no pasó mucho tiempo antes de que se encontrara con otro pequeño claro, y al final del claro había una cabaña, y frente a esa cabaña se sentaba un gran gigante negro con un tambor.
"¡Buen día para ti!" rugió el gigante, con una gran voz.
"¡Buen día!" dijo el joven, algo asustado.
"¡Ven y come algo!" rugió el gigante.
"Gracias," dijo el joven.
Se sentaron, y el gigante le ofreció algo de comida.
Pero el joven pensó que era más seguro no aceptar la comida del gigante, así que sacó su cuenco y deseó un poco de sopa, y la sorbió.
"¿Qué es eso?" preguntó el gigante.
El joven le dijo que era un cuenco de deseos, que daba cualquier comida que quisiera.
El gigante estaba muy contento con el cuenco de deseos, y pensó que si pudiera conseguir ese cuenco, podría comer sin el problema de conseguir cosas.
"¡Comprarás ese cuenco!" rugió.
"¿Qué me darás a cambio?" preguntó el joven.
"Te daré este tambor," dijo el gigante.
"Si golpeas un lado, todos los que lo escuchen huirán."
"¡Ah, por eso los leones y tigres estaban huyendo hace un momento!" dijo el joven.  
"Sí," dijo el gigante.  
"Y si golpeas del otro lado, un espléndido ejército de soldados y caballos surgirá del suelo y te defenderá."  
"Está bien, aquí tienes," dijo el joven, y le dio el cuenco.  
¡El gigante tomó el cuenco con gran alegría, y horrendo de contar, deseó en voz alta un cuenco lleno de sangre!  
Comenzó a beberlo, pero no lo terminó; porque al enterrar su nariz en el cuenco, el joven golpeó su hacha y dijo: "¡Cabezas!" ¡El hacha cayó con un estruendo sobre la cabeza del gigante y la cortó en dos!  
Si el joven se alegró al ver la cabeza del gigante partida en dos, se alegró aún más al entrar en la cabaña del gigante.  
Porque allí, alrededor de la pared, estaban los cuerpos de los viajeros que habían pasado por ese camino; y estaban atados a los postes de la pared, y sus cuerpos estaban secos como el polvo, y marchitos como un níspero.  
Porque este gigante solía atrapar a todos los viajeros y atarlos en su casa, y luego chupaba su sangre hasta que estaban secos.  
Así que cuando nuestro viajero vio qué estrecho escape había tenido, decidió no permanecer más en ese lugar espantoso.  
Levantando el cuenco y el tambor, y asegurándose de que su hacha y su diamante estaban a salvo, deseó estar en la puerta de la ciudad más cercana.  
Ahora, el rey de esta ciudad era un rey muy cruel.  
Solía robar y asesinar incluso a sus propios súbditos; y en cuanto a los extraños, no tenía piedad ni compasión por ellos.  
Así que cuando el rey oyó que había un extraño fuera de las puertas, decidió divertirse un poco; y envió a una compañía de soldados a traerlo.  
El joven golpeó su tambor, ¡y todos salieron corriendo!  
Puedes imaginarte cuán enojado estaba el rey al oír esto; hizo que le cortaran la cabeza en el acto, y envió un regimiento.  
Lo mismo le ocurrió al regimiento.  
Pero esto solo hizo que el rey se enojara más que nunca.  
Ordenó que todo su ejército se formara ante las puertas, y él mismo montando al frente, los llevó hacia adelante para capturar a este audaz extraño.  
Entonces el joven volcó su cuenco de deseos.
De repente, un torrente rugiente de agua inundó la llanura y ahogó a cada soldado del ejército, excepto al rey, que había galopado de regreso a la ciudad y se había subido a la muralla.  
Entonces, el joven golpeó su hacha y gritó: "¡Cabezas! ¡Quiero la cabeza del rey!" El hacha voló por el aire como un boomerang, le cortó la cabeza al rey y la trajo de vuelta a su amo.  
La gente dentro de la ciudad comenzó a vitorear de alegría al ver al rey sin cabeza.  
Y cuando el hacha regresó, el joven golpeó el otro lado de su tambor; y he aquí,  
la tierra comenzó a temblar, parecía estar llena de agujeros, y de cada agujero brotó un guerrero completamente armado.  
Rodeado por su ejército, marchó hacia la ciudad, donde se convirtió en rey y vivió feliz para siempre.  
Y espero que podamos ser la mitad de felices que él fue.`;
