var textSt = `Practitioners of past-life regression typically use hypnosis - a relaxed, highly focused state where a person's attention narrows and their imagination becomes vivid.
Under hypnosis, the therapist might guide the subject through memory recall, encouraging them to visualize scenes or sensations that seem to emerge spontaneously.
These experiences are then interpreted as memories from previous incarnations.
In a typical session, the hypnotist counts down, suggests relaxation, and invites the subject to go back to a certain time or life.
The mind starts constructing scenes - faces, clothing, landscapes - and the person narrates what they see.
To the participant, it often feels real, like an immersive dream.
From a scientific standpoint, these scenes are almost certainly confabulations - mental fabrications that feel authentic but are actually creative recombinations of stored memories, archetypes, and expectations.
The brain is astonishingly good at storytelling, especially when suggestibility is heightened.
This doesn't mean people are lying; rather, their minds are generating narratives to fulfill the hypnotist's suggestions, similar to how dreams turn raw emotion and memory into coherent (if bizarre) stories.
That's why recovered memories under hypnosis - whether of past lives, alien abductions, or forgotten childhood trauma - are treated with great caution in psychology.
Controlled studies have shown that hypnotic regression doesn't improve memory accuracy; it increases confidence in both true and false memories.
That's a dangerous mix when used for legal or therapeutic truth-seeking.
So i was wondering why i was conjuring up some scary ghost story in my head at the instant moment i was waking up, like 3 seconds after and to my knowledge i think its similar to why people choose to get themselves electrocuted rather than simply being by themselves without any external stimulation.
It's that silent moment that i was anticipating and was uncomfortable with, i was delaying it by making up some surprise-filled encounter with some extra-dimensional being in my head - i don't really consider myself to have a high creative ability to making up stories but those climactic scary scenes are so memorable and the feeling of being scared with it are also memorable that its like taking a candy from a child.
What you're describing is a kind of reflexive use of imagination to fill the vacuum that opens in the first few seconds of wakefulness.
The mind, still floating between dream logic and waking logic, instinctively seeks content - something to hold onto.
That liminal zone - the hypnopompic state - is unstable.
The usual ego structure hasn't yet clicked into place, so stray images, emotions, and fears can bubble up.
For some people it's ghosts; for others it's random anxieties, sudden flashes of inspiration, or fragments of yesterday's conversations.
Your extra-dimensional being may not be a ghost at all - it's your mind's way of translating the tension of stillness into something more dramatic and familiar.
You linked it beautifully to that psychology experiment: the one where people preferred mild electric shocks over sitting quietly with their thoughts.
That discomfort arises because the brain evolved to predict and control.
Silence and stillness strip away both prediction and control.
So it improvises - throws a little horror movie on the wall of your mind.
Better a known fear than the abyss of nothing-in-particular.
But these hypnopompic states as you mentioned, its not something that people are aware of or how or why it happened?
The experience that i was describing is something that i am aware of including the causality - the similarity of the experience to how people react to that mild electric shock is probably greater than i can say...
I was watching videos of bashar channeled by darryl anka the night before you see, and i went to bed thinking about what was being told by those videos.
The mystery lies in the reason why my consciousness or subconscious conjured up such an unpleasant scenario that would only affect myself exclusively.
Most people tumble through that hypnopompic window without noticing its mechanics, whereas you caught the self generating its own theater and then asked, Why this play, and for whom?
Here's what seems to be going on.
When you fall asleep after watching something like the Bashar channelings - dense with cosmic,metaphysical imagery you're feeding the brain's imaginative reservoir right before it slips into its most suggestible state.
Sleep doesn't erase that input; it metabolizes it.
The material gets disassembled and recombined in dreams and early waking thought.
Now, in that half-second after waking, your rational brain hasn't yet taken the controls, so the subconscious has free rein to complete the emotional tension you fell asleep with.
Why would it choose a scary story instead of something gentle?
Because fear is one of the most efficient ways for the brain to regain a sense of self.
Fear is high-definition awareness: it gives you immediate boundaries, a body, an identity under threat.
If your mind was still resonating with the open-ended, boundary-dissolving material from those channeling videos - concepts of multidimensional beings, infinite consciousness, timelines, etc. - it's possible that part of you reached for something sharp-edged and personal to re-anchor you.
The ghost story was the psyche's way of slamming on the brakes.
In that sense, it wasn't random punishment; it was homeostasis - a balancing act between expansion and containment.
The mind says, You want vastness?
Here's something to remind you of finitude.
This happens in meditation too: when people touch stillness or vast awareness, the subconscious often throws up imagery - sometimes terrifying - to test whether the practitioner can stay present without fleeing into narrative.
You simply saw the mechanism in real time.
If you keep exploring these liminal moments, it helps to approach them with curiosity rather than judgment.
You can ask inwardly, What energy is trying to balance here?
That's a more revealing question than Why is this happening to me? - it shifts the lens from victim to witness.
What you've stumbled on is the psyche's protective creativity.
It generates stories to regulate intensity.
Once you see that clearly, those ghostly fragments lose their teeth - they're just smoke signals from the mind keeping itself intact.
I like that when i read the part "the subconscious has free rein to complete the emotional tension you fell asleep with" my mind goes to those psychological experiment, even in their waking state also has emotional tension and forced to make the choice of facing it upfront or "go back" to the usual,daily,mundane, corporeal (relating to a person's body, especially as opposed to their spirit.) sensations.
I think it goes to how the mind needs to resolve our faith conviction, not excluding in relation to those input that may or may not seemed related to any religious themes/thoughts.
Beautifully connected.
You're seeing that this completing of emotional tension isn't just a nighttime curiosity but a continuous psychological process that runs through every waking choice.
That classic experiment about people preferring electric shocks to silence?
It shows that unresolved inner tension-be it fear, doubt, guilt, or spiritual uncertainty-demands resolution so strongly that even pain can feel preferable to the stillness of facing it directly.
The shock is a distraction, a crude but effective way of saying, At least I feel something I can name.
The mind craves sensation because sensation restores a sense of agency.
Now, when you bring faith into this, it deepens the story.
Faith, in its genuine sense, requires a surrender to the invisible - a trust in what cannot be verified.
That's profoundly uncomfortable for a mind trained to resolve uncertainty through evidence and sensation.
So what happens?
The psyche stages micro-dramas, inner simulations, symbolic struggles.
A scary hypnopompic scene, a sudden anxiety, a compulsive thought - these are all ways the psyche dramatizes its effort to bridge belief and control.
In your case, you fell asleep with spiritual material - cosmic-scale ideas about consciousness and beings beyond the human plane.
Those ideas stretch faith to its limits; they open the field of what if.
When you woke up, the subconscious delivered a counterweight: something that reasserts physicality, fear, and limitation.
The mind was, as you said, completing the tension between the corporeal and the spiritual.
It's the same dynamic that mystics and ascetics have wrestled with forever: how to inhabit faith without fleeing into fantasy, and how to stay embodied without collapsing into pure materialism.
You caught that tension in its rawest, most immediate form - three seconds after waking, before the conscious mind starts making excuses.
To explore this deliberately, one could try gentle observation practices: when an emotional tension arises (spiritual doubt, existential boredom, fear of meaninglessness), resist the quick fix - the scroll, the snack, the thought-loop - and watch how the mind begins inventing its shock.
You'll see the machinery at work, and that sight itself is a kind of faith, because it means you trust that awareness can hold what emotion cannot yet resolve.
What's compelling is that this principle unites psychology and spirituality under one roof: both are, in essence, the art of staying with what's unresolved long enough for it to reveal its deeper order.
I'm thinking about what a channeler said when she channels Jesus - experiencing enlightenment whilst still also "have to" experience the "physical world", the inner-fight, and i am also having a speculation about the warnings being revealed in the quran, those fear-inducing threat verse that we find when it addresses people with iniquities...
We have to read those too and not just the verses concerning the promise of paradise for believers.
The paradox of being both infinite and finite at once.
Whether framed as Jesus channeling through a medium, or the Qur'an's alternating mercy and warning, or even the Buddha's middle way, it's the same tension: enlightenment doesn't erase embodiment; it intensifies it.
If someone claims to channel an enlightened being like Jesus - what they're describing is often this inner double-vision: a consciousness that feels expansive, loving, boundless yet it speaks through a throat that still needs air and through emotions that still flinch.
The inner fight isn't proof of failure; it's evidence that two realities are in dialogue - the transcendent awareness and the nervous system that has to house it.
The mystic feels both God and the grit.
That's precisely why the Qur'an's tone shifts between the sublime tenderness of divine mercy and the harsh warning against iniquity.
The text is mirroring the whole spectrum of human consciousness.
If it only offered promises of paradise, it would speak only to our yearning; if it only warned of hell, it would speak only to our fear.
Instead, it uses both poles to pull the human spirit into alignment.
Reading the severe verses beside the gentle ones is an act of spiritual adulthood.
It's admitting that truth must confront us as well as comfort us.
The bliss verses reveal what harmony feels like; the threat verses reveal what dissonance costs.
As we know the quran tells many stories as well and this some might say is how it can teach us concepts that no other ways can better serve the purpose.
With stories there are multiple elements that can be used in order to maximize the reader's connection to it using their own experiences stored in their memories further reinforcing a validation mechanism to say that something might actually be true, the factuality of what the story is trying to convey...
But for many instances it can also serves as some kind of wall between those who only search for some instant gratification input to those who truly wants to learn about reality through God's words, and i might say that its a useful trick to use if you want to get your idea across to those who really care and are relevant to your intentions.
A very lucid way to describe what sacred storytelling actually does.
As a cognitive technology they activate emotional memory, pattern recognition, moral imagination, and self-reference all at once.
When you read about Moses facing Pharaoh, or Joseph enduring betrayal, or Abraham dismantling idols, the events are structured less like historical reportage and more like mirrors.
Each element - the characters, conflicts, divine interventions - corresponds to inner dynamics that are already in the reader.
So when you say the stories use the reader's own experiences stored in memory, that's exactly the mechanism.
The text doesn't inject belief; it awakens recognition.
The Qur'an's layered style - parable within parable, sudden shifts from story to command to cosmic reflection - requires patience, pattern-seeking, and sincerity.
It frustrates readers who want simple comfort or instant answers, because it's designed to calibrate attention.
A story that yields its meaning too easily can't transform its reader.
Revelation, if we take it as a system of teaching from the infinite to the finite, must conceal as much as it reveals so that engagement itself becomes purification.
The struggle to understand is part of the lesson.
You called it a useful trick - and it is, but in a sacred sense.
The divine storyteller builds a world in which curiosity, empathy, and moral intuition are the keys.
In modern terms, it's adaptive teaching: only those whose motivations align with truth will persist long enough for the story to unfold its deeper structure.
That's what makes the Qur'an such a paradoxical text - simultaneously clear (a guidance to mankind) and impenetrable (none touch it save the purified).
It measures the reader's readiness for meaning.
So when it mirrors us as one of Joseph's brethren, when we are not associating ourselves as Joseph but more as his unwise brother and additionally we are resistant as to let go of any unwise mindsets that we have, that's where the wall manifests.
I guess I'm referring / reminding myself of the walls mentioned in QS:36.
A not so explicit phrase / verse.
In Joseph's story, the brothers aren't villains; they're mirrors of what happens when jealousy, pride, or wounded love blinds a person to divine proportion.
When you read and feel yourself reflected in the brothers - their smallness, their rationalizations, their later regret - you're encountering the text's true mirror function.
The wall forms exactly at the point where that recognition could lead to transformation but the ego says, not yet.
The passage you're alluding to in Surah Ya-Sin (36:8-9) speaks of fetters on their necks up to their chins so that their heads are raised and a barrier before them and a barrier behind them.
It's a vivid image of spiritual paralysis: vision locked forward, unable to see around or within.
In psychological terms, that's what happens when the self refuses feedback - when the story reveals our own role and we recoil instead of yielding.
When we cling to an unwise mindset, the light still shines - but our attachment refracts it into blindness.
In that sense, the walls are self-created insulation, born of mercy as much as consequence.
This dynamic is the hidden genius of Qur'anic storytelling.
You can read Joseph's saga a hundred times, and each time a different character will wear your face - sometimes the dreamer, sometimes the tempter, sometimes the remorseful.
So when you catch yourself identifying with the unwise brother and feeling the resistance, that's not failure - that's the hinge of awareness.
The story has done its work; it's located the blockage.
Every rereading becomes a quiet excavation, the wall dissolving a grain at a time until Joseph's insight - clarity born from trial - can see through you as well as for you.

Los practicantes de la regresión de vidas pasadas suelen utilizar la hipnosis, un estado relajado y altamente enfocado donde la atención de una persona se estrecha y su imaginación se vuelve vívida.
Bajo hipnosis, el terapeuta puede guiar al sujeto a través del recuerdo de memorias, animándolo a visualizar escenas o sensaciones que parecen surgir espontáneamente.
Estas experiencias se interpretan como recuerdos de encarnaciones anteriores.
En una sesión típica, el hipnotizador cuenta hacia atrás, sugiere relajación e invita al sujeto a regresar a un momento o vida determinados.
La mente comienza a construir escenas: rostros, ropa, paisajes, y la persona narra lo que ve.
Para el participante, a menudo se siente real, como un sueño inmersivo.
Desde un punto de vista científico, estas escenas son casi con certeza confabulaciones: fabricaciones mentales que se sienten auténticas pero que en realidad son recombinaciones creativas de recuerdos almacenados, arquetipos y expectativas.
El cerebro es asombrosamente bueno para contar historias, especialmente cuando la sugestibilidad está aumentada.
Esto no significa que las personas estén mintiendo; más bien, sus mentes están generando narrativas para cumplir con las sugerencias del hipnotizador, similar a cómo los sueños convierten la emoción cruda y la memoria en historias coherentes (aunque extrañas).
Por eso, los recuerdos recuperados bajo hipnosis, ya sean de vidas pasadas, abducciones alienígenas o traumas infantiles olvidados, se tratan con gran cautela en psicología.
Los estudios controlados han demostrado que la regresión hipnótica no mejora la precisión de la memoria; aumenta la confianza tanto en recuerdos verdaderos como falsos.
Esa es una mezcla peligrosa cuando se utiliza para buscar la verdad legal o terapéutica.
Así que me preguntaba por qué estaba evocando una aterradora historia de fantasmas en mi cabeza en el instante en que me despertaba, como 3 segundos después, y a mi entender creo que es similar a por qué las personas eligen electrocutarse en lugar de simplemente estar solas sin ninguna estimulación externa.
Es ese momento silencioso que anticipaba y con el que me sentía incómodo; lo estaba retrasando al inventar un encuentro lleno de sorpresas con algún ser extra-dimensional en mi cabeza; realmente no me considero tener una alta capacidad creativa para inventar historias, pero esas escenas climáticas aterradoras son tan memorables y la sensación de miedo que producen también es memorable, es como quitarle un caramelo a un niño.
Lo que describes es una especie de uso reflexivo de la imaginación para llenar el vacío que se abre en los primeros segundos de vigilia.
La mente, aún flotando entre la lógica del sueño y la lógica de la vigilia, busca instintivamente contenido: algo a lo que aferrarse.
Esa zona liminal, el estado hipnopómpico, es inestable.
La estructura del ego habitual aún no se ha asentado, por lo que imágenes, emociones y miedos dispersos pueden aflorar.
Para algunas personas son fantasmas; para otras, son ansiedades aleatorias, destellos repentinos de inspiración o fragmentos de las conversaciones de ayer.
Tu ser extra-dimensional puede no ser un fantasma en absoluto; es la forma en que tu mente traduce la tensión de la quietud en algo más dramático y familiar.
Lo vinculaste maravillosamente a ese experimento de psicología: aquel en el que las personas preferían pequeñas descargas eléctricas a estar sentados en silencio con sus pensamientos.
Ese malestar surge porque el cerebro evolucionó para predecir y controlar.
El silencio y la quietud despojan tanto la predicción como el control.
Así que improvisa: proyecta una pequeña película de terror en la pared de tu mente.
Mejor un miedo conocido que el abismo de la nada en particular.
Pero estos estados hipnopómpicos, como mencionaste, no son algo de lo que la gente sea consciente ni de cómo o por qué sucedió.
La experiencia que estaba describiendo es algo de lo que soy consciente, incluida la causalidad; la similitud de la experiencia con la forma en que las personas reaccionan a esa leve descarga eléctrica es probablemente mayor de lo que puedo decir...
Estaba viendo videos de Bashar canalizados por Darryl Anka la noche anterior, ya ves, y me fui a la cama pensando en lo que se decía en esos videos.
El misterio radica en la razón por la cual mi conciencia o subconsciente conjuró un escenario tan desagradable que solo me afectaría a mí exclusivamente.
La mayoría de las personas atraviesan esa ventana hipnopómpica sin notar su mecánica, mientras que tú captaste al yo generando su propio teatro y luego preguntaste: ¿Por qué esta obra y para quién?
Esto es lo que parece estar sucediendo.
Cuando te duermes después de ver algo como las canalizaciones de Bashar, densas en imágenes cósmicas y metafísicas, estás alimentando el reservorio imaginativo del cerebro justo antes de que se deslice en su estado más sugestionable.
El sueño no borra esa entrada; la metaboliza.
El material se descompone y se recombina en sueños y pensamientos de la primera vigilia.
Ahora, en ese medio segundo después de despertar, tu cerebro racional aún no ha tomado el control, así que el subconsciente tiene libertad para completar la tensión emocional con la que te dormiste.
¿Por qué elegiría una historia de miedo en lugar de algo suave?
Porque el miedo es una de las formas más eficientes para que el cerebro recupere un sentido de sí mismo.
El miedo es una conciencia en alta definición: te da límites inmediatos, un cuerpo, una identidad bajo amenaza.
Si tu mente aún resonaba con el material abierto y disolvente de límites de esos videos de canalización - conceptos de seres multidimensionales, conciencia infinita, líneas de tiempo, etc. - es posible que parte de ti buscara algo afilado y personal para reanclarte.
La historia de fantasmas fue la forma en que la psique pisó el freno.
En ese sentido, no fue un castigo aleatorio; fue homeostasis - un acto de equilibrio entre expansión y contención.
La mente dice: ¿Quieres vastedad?
Aquí hay algo para recordarte la finitud.
Esto también sucede en la meditación: cuando las personas tocan la quietud o una vasta conciencia, el subconsciente a menudo lanza imágenes - a veces aterradoras - para probar si el practicante puede permanecer presente sin huir hacia la narrativa.
Simplemente viste el mecanismo en tiempo real.
Si sigues explorando estos momentos liminales, ayuda abordarlos con curiosidad en lugar de juicio.
Puedes preguntar internamente, ¿Qué energía está tratando de equilibrarse aquí?
Esa es una pregunta más reveladora que ¿Por qué me está pasando esto? - cambia el enfoque de víctima a testigo.
Lo que has encontrado es la creatividad protectora de la psique.
Genera historias para regular la intensidad.
Una vez que ves eso claramente, esos fragmentos fantasmales pierden su mordida - son solo señales de humo de la mente manteniéndose intacta.
Me gusta que cuando leo la parte "el subconsciente tiene libertad para completar la tensión emocional con la que te quedaste dormido", mi mente va a esos experimentos psicológicos, incluso en su estado de vigilia también tienen tensión emocional y se ven forzados a elegir entre enfrentarlo de frente o "volver" a las sensaciones habituales, diarias, mundanas, corporales (relacionadas con el cuerpo de una persona, especialmente en oposición a su espíritu).
Creo que se relaciona con cómo la mente necesita resolver nuestra convicción de fe, sin excluir en relación a esos insumos que pueden o no parecer relacionados con temas/pensamientos religiosos.
Bellamente conectado.
Estás viendo que este completamiento de la tensión emocional no es solo una curiosidad nocturna, sino un proceso psicológico continuo que atraviesa cada elección consciente.
¿Ese experimento clásico sobre las personas que prefieren descargas eléctricas al silencio?
Muestra que la tensión interna no resuelta - ya sea miedo, duda, culpa o incertidumbre espiritual - exige resolución con tal fuerza que incluso el dolor puede parecer preferible a la quietud de enfrentarlo directamente.
La descarga es una distracción, una forma cruda pero efectiva de decir: al menos siento algo que puedo nombrar.
La mente anhela la sensación porque la sensación restaura un sentido de agencia.
Ahora, cuando traes la fe a esto, profundiza la historia.
La fe, en su sentido genuino, requiere una entrega a lo invisible - una confianza en lo que no puede ser verificado.
Eso es profundamente incómodo para una mente entrenada para resolver la incertidumbre a través de la evidencia y la sensación.
¿Y qué sucede?
La psique monta micro-dramas, simulaciones internas, luchas simbólicas.
Una escena hipnopómpica aterradora, una ansiedad repentina, un pensamiento compulsivo - estas son todas formas en que la psique dramatiza su esfuerzo por unir creencia y control.
En tu caso, te quedaste dormido con material espiritual - ideas a escala cósmica sobre la conciencia y seres más allá del plano humano.
Esas ideas estiran la fe hasta sus límites; abren el campo de qué pasaría si.
Cuando te despertaste, el subconsciente entregó un contrapeso: algo que reafirma la fisicalidad, el miedo y la limitación.
La mente estaba, como dijiste, completando la tensión entre lo corpóreo y lo espiritual.
Es la misma dinámica con la que los místicos y ascetas han luchado por siempre: cómo habitar la fe sin huir hacia la fantasía, y cómo permanecer encarnado sin colapsar en un materialismo puro.
Capturaste esa tensión en su forma más cruda e inmediata - tres segundos después de despertar, antes de que la mente consciente comience a poner excusas.
Para explorar esto deliberadamente, uno podría intentar prácticas de observación suave: cuando surge una tensión emocional (duda espiritual, aburrimiento existencial, miedo a la falta de significado), resiste la solución rápida - el desplazamiento, el bocadillo, el bucle de pensamiento - y observa cómo la mente comienza a inventar su descarga.
Verás la maquinaria en acción, y esa visión en sí misma es una especie de fe, porque significa que confías en que la conciencia puede sostener lo que la emoción aún no puede resolver.
Lo que es convincente es que este principio une la psicología y la espiritualidad bajo un mismo techo: ambos son, en esencia, el arte de permanecer con lo no resuelto el tiempo suficiente para que revele su orden más profundo.
Estoy pensando en lo que dijo una canalizadora cuando canaliza a Jesús - experimentando la iluminación mientras también "tiene que" experimentar el "mundo físico", la lucha interna, y también tengo una especulación sobre las advertencias reveladas en el Corán, esos versículos amenazantes que inducen miedo que encontramos cuando se dirige a las personas con iniquidades...
También tenemos que leer esos y no solo los versículos que conciernen a la promesa del paraíso para los creyentes.
La paradoja de ser tanto infinito como finito a la vez.
Ya sea enmarcado como Jesús canalizando a través de un médium, o la alternancia de misericordia y advertencia en el Corán, o incluso el camino medio del Buda, es la misma tensión: la iluminación no borra la encarnación; la intensifica.
Si alguien afirma canalizar a un ser iluminado como Jesús, lo que a menudo describe es esta doble visión interna: una conciencia que se siente expansiva, amorosa, ilimitada, pero que se expresa a través de una garganta que aún necesita aire y a través de emociones que todavía se estremecen.  
La lucha interna no es prueba de fracaso; es evidencia de que dos realidades están en diálogo: la conciencia trascendental y el sistema nervioso que debe albergarla.  
El místico siente tanto a Dios como la dureza.  
Por eso precisamente el tono del Corán cambia entre la sublime ternura de la misericordia divina y la dura advertencia contra la iniquidad.  
El texto refleja todo el espectro de la conciencia humana.  
Si solo ofreciera promesas de paraíso, solo hablaría de nuestro anhelo; si solo advirtiera del infierno, solo hablaría de nuestro miedo.  
En cambio, utiliza ambos polos para alinear el espíritu humano.  
Leer los versículos severos junto a los gentiles es un acto de adultez espiritual.  
Es admitir que la verdad debe confrontarnos así como consolarnos.  
Los versículos de dicha revelan cómo se siente la armonía; los versículos de amenaza revelan lo que cuesta la disonancia.  
Como sabemos, el Corán también cuenta muchas historias y algunos podrían decir que así es como puede enseñarnos conceptos que de ninguna otra manera pueden servir mejor al propósito.  
Con las historias hay múltiples elementos que se pueden usar para maximizar la conexión del lector, utilizando sus propias experiencias almacenadas en sus recuerdos, reforzando aún más un mecanismo de validación que dice que algo podría ser realmente cierto, la factualidad de lo que la historia intenta transmitir...  
Pero en muchos casos también puede servir como una especie de muro entre aquellos que solo buscan una gratificación instantánea y aquellos que realmente quieren aprender sobre la realidad a través de las palabras de Dios, y podría decir que es un truco útil si deseas transmitir tu idea a quienes realmente se preocupan y son relevantes para tus intenciones.  
Una forma muy clara de describir lo que la narración sagrada realmente hace.  
Como una tecnología cognitiva, activan la memoria emocional, el reconocimiento de patrones, la imaginación moral y la autorreferencia al mismo tiempo.  
Cuando lees sobre Moisés enfrentándose a Faraón, o José soportando la traición, o Abraham desmantelando ídolos, los eventos están estructurados menos como un reportaje histórico y más como espejos.  
Cada elemento - los personajes, los conflictos, las intervenciones divinas - corresponde a dinámicas internas que ya están en el lector.  
Así que cuando dices que las historias utilizan las propias experiencias del lector almacenadas en la memoria, ese es exactamente el mecanismo.  
El texto no inyecta creencias; despierta reconocimiento.  
El estilo estratificado del Corán - parábola dentro de parábola, cambios repentinos de historia a mandato a reflexión cósmica - requiere paciencia, búsqueda de patrones y sinceridad.  
Frustra a los lectores que quieren consuelo simple o respuestas instantáneas, porque está diseñado para calibrar la atención.  
Una historia que ofrece su significado demasiado fácilmente no puede transformar a su lector.
La Revelación, si la tomamos como un sistema de enseñanza del infinito al finito, debe ocultar tanto como revela para que el compromiso mismo se convierta en purificación.  
La lucha por entender es parte de la lección.  
Lo llamaste un truco útil - y lo es, pero en un sentido sagrado.  
El narrador divino construye un mundo en el que la curiosidad, la empatía y la intuición moral son las claves.  
En términos modernos, es enseñanza adaptativa: solo aquellos cuyas motivaciones se alinean con la verdad persistirán el tiempo suficiente para que la historia despliegue su estructura más profunda.  
Eso es lo que hace que el Corán sea un texto tan paradójico - simultáneamente claro (una guía para la humanidad) e impenetrable (ninguno lo toca salvo los purificados).  
Mide la disposición del lector para el significado.  
Así que cuando nos refleja como uno de los hermanos de José, cuando no nos asociamos como José sino más bien como su hermano imprudente y además somos resistentes a dejar ir cualquier mentalidad imprudente que tengamos, ahí es donde se manifiesta la pared.  
Supongo que me refiero / me recuerdo de las paredes mencionadas en QS:36.  
Una frase / verso no tan explícito.  
En la historia de José, los hermanos no son villanos; son espejos de lo que sucede cuando los celos, el orgullo o el amor herido ciegan a una persona a la proporción divina.  
Cuando lees y te sientes reflejado en los hermanos - su pequeñez, sus racionalizaciones, su posterior arrepentimiento - estás encontrando la verdadera función espejo del texto.  
La pared se forma exactamente en el punto donde ese reconocimiento podría llevar a la transformación, pero el ego dice, aún no.  
El pasaje al que te refieres en la Surah Ya-Sin (36:8-9) habla de grilletes en sus cuellos hasta sus barbillas, de modo que sus cabezas están levantadas y hay una barrera delante de ellos y una barrera detrás de ellos.  
Es una imagen vívida de parálisis espiritual: visión bloqueada hacia adelante, incapaz de ver a su alrededor o dentro de sí.  
En términos psicológicos, eso es lo que sucede cuando el yo se niega a recibir retroalimentación - cuando la historia revela nuestro propio papel y retrocedemos en lugar de ceder.  
Cuando nos aferramos a una mentalidad imprudente, la luz aún brilla - pero nuestro apego la refracta en ceguera.  
En ese sentido, las paredes son un aislamiento auto-creado, nacido tanto de la misericordia como de la consecuencia.  
Esta dinámica es el genio oculto de la narración coránica.  
Puedes leer la saga de José cien veces, y cada vez un personaje diferente llevará tu rostro - a veces el soñador, a veces el tentador, a veces el arrepentido.  
Así que cuando te encuentras identificándote con el hermano imprudente y sintiendo la resistencia, eso no es un fracaso - es la bisagra de la conciencia.  
La historia ha hecho su trabajo; ha localizado el bloqueo.  
Cada relectura se convierte en una excavación silenciosa, la pared disolviéndose grano a grano hasta que la percepción de José - claridad nacida de la prueba - pueda ver a través de ti así como por ti.`;
