var textSt = `In a small town lived a boy named David.
He was smart, hardworking, and had big dreams like becoming the top student in class, mastering new skills, and building a bright future.
But David had one habit that was quietly creating problems in his life.
He talked too much about unnecessary things.
Whenever he learned something new, he couldn't keep it to himself.
He would tell everyone about his plans, his dreams, his goals, even personal thoughts and feelings.
David believed that sharing his plans would keep him motivated.
He also enjoyed the praise and admiration he received from friends, parents, and even teachers.
But even after saying so many great things, success wasn't coming.
In recent exams, his results were average.
He couldn't understand what was going wrong.
To make things worse, some people started making fun of him.
Feeling low, David went to visit his grandfather one weekend.
But even there, he couldn't stop worrying.
Seeing him quiet and sad, his grandfather asked, "What's the matter, son? Why do you look so down?"
David opened up.
I tell everyone about my dreams, but I'm not able to achieve them.
And lately, I feel like I'm losing interest in them, too.
His grandfather listened carefully and then said, "David, it's because you share your dreams with everyone."
"That's why you're losing interest."
David was surprised.
"Really?"
The grandfather nodded and began to tell him a story.
"Many years ago in a village there was a farmer named Thomas."
"He was poor but hardworking."
"He had a dream to build a big farm full of crops and one day live a better life."
"Every day he worked hard in the fields and saved every penny he could."
"But Thomas had one rule."
"He never shared his plans with anyone."
People would often ask, "Why do you work so hard all the time?"
and Thomas would just smile and say, "You'll understand in time."
Years passed.
Slowly, Thomas bought one small piece of land, then another.
He grew crops and earned money.
One year he built a proper farm.
The next year, he built a lovely house.
Everyone in the village was shocked.
They had no idea how he achieved so much.
One day an old friend visited him and asked, "Why didn't you ever share your dreams with anyone?"
Thomas smiled and said, "When you talk too much, two things happen."
"One, people try to discourage you."
"Two, you waste your energy talking instead of doing."
"Silence protects your goals."
"Words are like arrows."
"Once released, you can't take them back."
"I wanted my success to speak for me."
Hearing this, David began to understand.
His grandfather added, "Son, when you talk too much about your dreams, not everyone will be happy for you."
"Some will try to bring you down."
"Also, when you talk about your goals, your brain starts to feel like you've already achieved something."
"So, your motivation to work drops."
David was silent for a moment.
Then he asked, "Grandpa, how can I change myself?"
The grandfather smiled.
"From today, speak less about your plans and focus more on action."
Let your success be your voice.
Remember, silence holds a powerful energy.
That day changed David.
He stopped talking about his plans to others.
He studied harder, worked quietly, and avoided unnecessary conversations.
Months passed and David saw a clear change in himself.
His confidence grew.
He stopped caring about people's opinions and this time in the final exam, David ranked first in school.
Everyone was amazed.
His friends asked, "How did you do it?"
David just smiled and remembered his grandfather's words.
"Stay silent."
"You can achieve everything."
A few years later, David became a successful entrepreneur.
His story inspired many.
He proved that true success comes from doing, not just talking.
The strongest voice is silence.
Speak less, work more, let your success do the talking.
Talking less or more depends on personality and neither is wrong.
But always remember, you don't need to share everything with everyone, especially your dreams, goals, and future plans.
Keep them to yourself until you've made real progress.
Because sometimes just talking gives you fake satisfaction, and that satisfaction slows your hard work.
Build yourself so strong that your work becomes your language and your success becomes your answer.
Work quietly and when the time is right, the world will know what you've achieved.

In einer kleinen Stadt lebte ein Junge namens David.
Er war klug, fleißig und hatte große Träume, wie der beste Schüler der Klasse zu werden, neue Fähigkeiten zu meistern und eine strahlende Zukunft aufzubauen.
Aber David hatte eine Angewohnheit, die still und leise Probleme in seinem Leben verursachte.
Er redete zu viel über unnötige Dinge.
Immer wenn er etwas Neues lernte, konnte er es nicht für sich behalten.
Er erzählte jedem von seinen Plänen, seinen Träumen, seinen Zielen, sogar persönlichen Gedanken und Gefühlen.
David glaubte, dass das Teilen seiner Pläne ihn motivieren würde.
Er genoss auch das Lob und die Bewunderung, die er von Freunden, Eltern und sogar Lehrern erhielt.
Aber selbst nachdem er so viele großartige Dinge erzählt hatte, blieb der Erfolg aus.
In den letzten Prüfungen waren seine Ergebnisse nur durchschnittlich.
Er konnte nicht verstehen, was schief lief.
Um die Sache noch schlimmer zu machen, begannen sich einige Leute über ihn lustig zu machen.
Niedergeschlagen besuchte David eines Wochenendes seinen Großvater.
Aber selbst dort konnte er nicht aufhören, sich Sorgen zu machen.
Als sein Großvater ihn still und traurig sah, fragte er: "Was ist los, mein Sohn? Warum siehst du so niedergeschlagen aus?"
David öffnete sein Herz.
Ich erzähle jedem von meinen Träumen, aber ich schaffe es nicht, sie zu erreichen.
Und in letzter Zeit habe ich das Gefühl, dass ich das Interesse daran verliere.
Sein Großvater hörte aufmerksam zu und sagte dann: "David, das liegt daran, dass du deine Träume mit jedem teilst."
"Deshalb verlierst du das Interesse."
David war überrascht.
"Wirklich?"
Der Großvater nickte und begann, ihm eine Geschichte zu erzählen.
"Vor vielen Jahren lebte in einem Dorf ein Bauer namens Thomas."
"Er war arm, aber fleißig."
"Er hatte den Traum, einen großen Bauernhof voller Feldfrüchte aufzubauen und eines Tages ein besseres Leben zu führen."
"Jeden Tag arbeitete er hart auf den Feldern und sparte jeden Cent, den er konnte."
"Aber Thomas hatte eine Regel."
"Er teilte seine Pläne niemals mit jemandem."
Die Leute fragten oft: "Warum arbeitest du die ganze Zeit so hart?"
und Thomas lächelte nur und sagte: "Ihr werdet es mit der Zeit verstehen."
Jahre vergingen.
Langsam kaufte Thomas ein kleines Stück Land, dann noch eines.
Er baute Feldfrüchte an und verdiente Geld.
Ein Jahr baute er einen richtigen Bauernhof.
Im nächsten Jahr baute er ein schönes Haus.
Alle im Dorf waren schockiert.
Sie hatten keine Ahnung, wie er so viel erreicht hatte.
Eines Tages besuchte ihn ein alter Freund und fragte: "Warum hast du nie deine Träume mit jemandem geteilt?"
Thomas lächelte und sagte: "Wenn du zu viel redest, passieren zwei Dinge."
"Erstens versuchen die Leute, dich zu entmutigen."
"Zweitens verschwendest du deine Energie an Reden, anstatt zu handeln."
"Schweigen schützt deine Ziele."
"Worte sind wie Pfeile."
"Sind sie erst losgelassen, kann man sie nicht mehr zurückholen."
"Ich wollte, dass mein Erfolg für mich spricht."
Als David das hörte, begann er zu verstehen.
Sein Großvater fügte hinzu: "Mein Sohn, wenn du zu viel über deine Träume sprichst, werden nicht alle sich für dich freuen."
"Einige werden versuchen, dich runterzuziehen."
"Außerdem fängt dein Gehirn an, sich so zu fühlen, als hättest du schon etwas erreicht, wenn du über deine Ziele sprichst."
"Also sinkt deine Motivation zu arbeiten."
David schwieg einen Moment.
Dann fragte er: "Opa, wie kann ich mich ändern?"
Der Großvater lächelte.
"Von heute an sprich weniger über deine Pläne und konzentriere dich mehr aufs Handeln."
Lass deinen Erfolg deine Stimme sein.
Denk daran, Stille birgt eine kraftvolle Energie.
Dieser Tag veränderte David.
Er hörte auf, anderen von seinen Plänen zu erzählen.
Er lernte härter, arbeitete still und vermied unnötige Gespräche.
Monate vergingen und David sah eine deutliche Veränderung an sich.
Sein Selbstvertrauen wuchs.
Er hörte auf, sich um die Meinungen anderer zu kümmern, und diesmal belegte David in der Abschlussprüfung den ersten Platz in der Schule.
Alle waren erstaunt.
Seine Freunde fragten: "Wie hast du das geschafft?"
David lächelte nur und erinnerte sich an die Worte seines Großvaters.
"Bleib still."
"Du kannst alles erreichen."
Einige Jahre später wurde David ein erfolgreicher Unternehmer.
Seine Geschichte inspirierte viele.
Er bewies, dass wahrer Erfolg vom Handeln kommt, nicht nur vom Reden.
Die stärkste Stimme ist die Stille.
Sprich weniger, arbeite mehr, lass deinen Erfolg für sich sprechen.
Weniger oder mehr zu reden hängt von der Persönlichkeit ab und keines von beiden ist falsch.
Aber denk immer daran, du musst nicht alles mit jedem teilen, besonders nicht deine Träume, Ziele und Zukunftspläne.
Behalte sie für dich, bis du echte Fortschritte gemacht hast.
Denn manchmal gibt dir das Reden allein eine falsche Zufriedenheit, und diese Zufriedenheit verlangsamt deine harte Arbeit.
Baue dich so stark auf, dass deine Arbeit deine Sprache und dein Erfolg deine Antwort wird.
Arbeite still und wenn die Zeit reif ist, wird die Welt wissen, was du erreicht hast.
